# Traveling to Perth

## Prologue

The dark hulk drifted across the dim fire of an ancient sun. Emptiness and fear overwhelmed. She knew, she knew, the ship carried something else.

Death.

## Part 1: On Their Way

### Episode 1: Perilous Journey

#### Chapter 1: The Journey

##### Scene 1.1: Night Terrors

Kaylah woke screaming.

The screams echoed off metal walls as she struggled for control.

She huddled in her berth. Her screams faded to sobs.

*Why?* Her heart pounded. *Why again?*

Vainly she shook her head in an attempt to erase the horrific images of the drifting, frozen bodies around the broken black hulk of a spacecraft…

*It’s all… It’s all so horrible*.

She stared into blackness, shivering in the cold, struggling to mute her sobs.

The bunk lamp turned on. Its feeble light barely illuminated her father's pale, bearded face.

*What? I didn’t—* *I didn’t hear him climb down from the top berth*.

Without speaking he patted her shoulder awkwardly.

Angry stomping came their way, accompanied by vibrations that shook the bunk frames and rattled and echoed around the packed cabin.

The thumps stopped, leaving the sound of furious breathing over murmurs around them.

She hesitantly peeked around her father, her gasping sobs still too loud in their echoes.  She futilely swiped at her tears with one hand.

The man with the pot-belly from two bunks over, Mr. Clarke, loomed beside her bunk. His bleary and red-shot eyes frosted her with a glare sinister in the shadowy dimness. He leaned in to hiss at her, the spittle flying and barely missing her face. “Shut up!”

She shrank back.

Her father, angling his body in front of her, extended an arm to brace against the aluminum frames at the end of the bunks, enclosing her sleeping space. He said, placatingly, “Kids have-a bad dreams, uh, sometimes.”

“It’s all the time,” Mr. Clarke growled. “We all have to sleep.”

The murmurs around grew to an angry hum of voices swelling into echoes of their own, the sounds mixing with Mr. Clarke’s heavy footfalls as he stomped back to his bunk.

Kaylah’s tears flowed.

*He’s really mad. Again.*

She bit her lip.  Her clenched and unclenched against the rough edge of the coarse blanket. A hiccup erupted without warning, loud against metallic walls and wracking her body. A second hiccup followed before she could even close her mouth.

From above her, in the middle bunk, her grandmother whispered, “Shhh… Go to sleep, Kaylah.”

She couldn’t stop shivering. Swallowing another hiccup, she slid down under the heavy blanket and tugged her old knit cap lower.

Her father gave her one last pat on her shoulder before turning off the bunk light. The aluminum frame of the bunks creaked as he climbed back to his own berth at the top of the triple-stack, the sound overlaying the fading whispers of the other passengers around them.

Gradually, the sounds in the narrow, cramped passenger cabin subsided. The ship’s ventilation fans kicked on.

Her body still jerking with each hiccup, her mouth still shut tight against the sounds, she curled into a tight ball.

*My nightmares are getting worse.*

--

##### Scene 1.2: Ship Intro

The ship rumbled on, a tiny bubble of light in vast blackness. Inside, forward from the passenger berths, past the ship’s drives and tucked behind conduit runs, was a sliver of a cabin.

Emmett exited humming a near-silent counterpoint to the engine’s rough vibrations. He maneuvered around the narrow alley’s conduits and pipes until the companionway. Here, the aluminum cold and smooth under his hands, he descended to to jog down the main corridor.
On his way forward he paused where jagged seams outlined a shinier, newer steel wall. He bowed his head and extended a palm to hover over a small plaque centered in the shine. A minute later, he resumed jogging forward. His breath puffed small clouds of vapor in the air.

Emmett reveled in the feel of the transport, its immensity wrapped around him. The drives and engines behind him, the passengers and cargo holds farther on, buttressed by immense water tanks.

“Aria, status check?” he asked. A wave of corridor lights brightened with his footfalls, illuminating his way and fading as he passed by.

Her melodic voice answered. “All systems are go.” She paused. “No change in the last 2.34 minutes.”

“Our course?”

“On target for arrival at water stop seven.” Her voice was melodic and rich.

“FTL?”

“Slight variations within normal parameters.”

Compulsively, he continued, “Debris?”

“No debris inside the field detectable above the 2 millimeter threshold. Tracking systems nominal.”

He continued. “Internal mechanics?”

“Forty-seven parts are nearing end-of-life but are still functioning within nominal parameters. Three air filters are on the schedule for replacement.”

“Supplies?”

“Adequate. Water levels down 5% from estimates.”

“I wonder if we have certain colonists finding a way around the water rationing again?”

“I have not detect—”

“Never mind.”

As he jogged, he scanned the corridor’s surfaces for signs of deterioration. “So, adequate. No threat to our planned water stops?”

“No, we are on target for water stop seven,” she repeated.

“Okay, thanks.”

Possible scenarios and responses whirled in his—

He skidded to a halt at the passage’s end. Shaking his head vigorously to clear it, he breathed deep. One breath, another. Three steps forward, and the bridge doors shushed shut behind him.

Around him stars flowed, filling the curved, floor-to-ceiling view screen that dominated the bridge. The sheer immensity of the screen dwarfed the crew, its glow reaching out to shine on the bald head of the first mate at nav, and, farther back, reaching the captain in the dimmer recesses.

The presence of the others barely registered with Emmett, the stars capturing his wonder – each of those stars, representing star system after star system nearby in real space — his scalp prickled. He forced himself to move on to nav, his eyes devouring the data displayed on-station, his hands already twitching.

He stopped next to the first mate and began, “You are…“ His voice broke, causing his ears to flush red. He continued, “You are relieved, sir.”

“I am relieved, Mr. Emmett.” Mr. Davis stretched languorously, flicked a half-wave, half-salute toward Captain Brio, and sauntered away, the star glow casting his faint flickering shadow on the deck.

Before the hatch had even shut after Mr. Davis – he made it “Mr.” even in thought – Emmett’s fingers were flying confidently over the nav station controls.

##### Scene 1.3: Colonists Intro

In the rec area, a converted cargo hold in the bowels of Brio’s Hope, more and more colonists were arriving. They surged around Kaylah as she weaved through the crowds. The cacophony reverberated off the metal walls, and she rubbed her ears while continuing to work her way through the crowd.

*I’m late, I’m late. Why did Dad have to TALK with me this morning, of all mornings? I don’t want to talk about it. Stupid nightmares.*

Her short curly black hair danced as she zigzagged around spectators watching couples attempting a very awkward-looking dance. *What the stellar?* She rolled her eyes and increased her speed. She passed the colony’s director and assistant director. The two were laughing, the director waving a fork in the air. *Funny how we only see him when there’s a party.*

The festival announcement had been a surprise — a good one. It was less than a year into the trip, but the ship seemed smaller each day.

*But why make the party a last-minute surprise? Some sort of psychological thing? Never mind, I don’t care. Food, food, food, food, food.*

She swept by a group of very happy and loud farmers wearing wearing Hawaiian shirts. One gestured expansively. “—this old bucket will get us safely to—”

Just ahead of her a band, instruments in-hand, pushed forward toward the stage with single-minded eagerness like an odd five-part organism. The bass guitarist -- one of the veterinary techs, she thought --  was pushed off-balance by the crowd. As he stumbled, his guitar case swept alarmingly close. Kaylah scrambled out of the way but fell into a teacher from her passenger cabin.

“Hey!” Kaylah called after the guitarist, but her voice was lost in the clamor of chatter, music, and raucous laughter echoing around the hold. She grimaced and rubbed her ears again.

“—you keeping us all awake! Just—” The teacher, with dark shadows under red, bleary eyes, griped at Kaylah.

*Uh-oh.*

“—times last week alone! It’s not getting better! It’s worse!”

Kaylah ran off, chased away by the teacher’s complaints — complaints that soon merged with the other sounds in the hold, and she forced a smile as she ducked and twisted her small body through more of the crowd.

*Here to have fun, here to have fun, here to have fun.*

“—emergency drills are useless—”

She curved around a table filled with people eating festival cakes.

“—last of cinnamon. Hosten didn’t order enough for the trip. Stupid bean counter—”

*I can’t believe Grandma wanted me to stay and do chores. Not come to the festival?? The first party we’ve had in months? So glad Dad told her to let me come and hang out with my friends. Friends? Ha!*

Delicious smells tickled her nose. Her eyes darted back and forth, watching for openings, as she continued through the crowd.

“—livestock apprenticeships on Perth will be in short supply for several years.”

*Yuck. Who likes mucking out stalls? Or dealing with sheep? They’re so stup— Cake!! They have cake!! I thought we had run out of stuff for cakes. Who knows when they’ll have cake again? Gonna get me some after. Or those brownies. They smell so good. Later, brownies!*

When she reached the line of colonists at the far end of the cargo hold, she peered on tip-toes, her nose twitching at the odors of too many unwashed passengers swirling and mixing with the scents of fresh-baked cake and coffee. She leaned to one side, then the other, in anticipation, then bounced up and down, trying to see around the taller passengers in front of her.

As she absently rubbed her ears again, she leaned to the side again, and spotted two of the teens, Jonah and Amy, farther ahead in the line. Amy waved at her, and she waved back.

*They both seem nice. They actually talk to me sometimes. Not like the other kids. And Amy—*

“Go away!” The older teenager in front of her had turned to glare at her.

Kaylah’s excited smile slipped. Nikka again?

“We don’t want you here.”

Warmth climbed Kaylah’s face, and moisture pooled in her eyes.

“Are you gonna cry?” taunted the older girl.

Kaylah looked away. Her bottom lip curled up and tightened.

The line inched forward, and Nikka turned away.

Blinking away moisture, Kaylah strained on tiptoe again, trying for her first glimpse of the diversion.

*What is it this time?*

This surprise for the colonists had been in work for weeks, hidden by tarps.

*We’re only 130.7 days into the trip, and people are…. restless? Bored? Irritable? Cabin-itis? What’s the word?* 

*But no one’s gone crazy yet. People are mean — but people are pretty mean — and no one’s gone crazy.*

She snorted.

*Give it time. We still have months and months and months—*

The line moved.

*Finally!*

There it was, filling most of this side of the hold: a maze-like structure stretching between the main hatch and kitchen and extending nearly to top of the hold.

*Wow! It’s huge.* She watched colonists climb and crawl through the obstacle course.

A wide smile spread across her face, bigger and bigger until the edge of her old parka tickled her cheeks.  

*Fantastic!*

Ahead of her, Nikka made loud comments to her friend about defective brains and hallucinations.

Kaylah squinted, examining the course.

*What did Mrs. Holang-Lee say? The course was something to help us with ennui. Ennui. I like that word. It fits. Passengers are—*

“You’re too small, freak.”

Her chin trembled. Kaylah threw Nikka a quick glance, then away again. She examined the structure.

*Huh. Looks like there’s more than one way through it. I think.*

“Next!” the man at the entrance gate gestured.

*Isn't he one of the black belts? Um... Master Geary. He seems kind. The classes are fun to watch. And the Australian instructor, Mr. Rudy -- he moves so smoothly when he does the forms. And the younger woman black belt...  What's her name? I think she's Vietnamese. She's so strong.*

Nikka and her friend moved toward the course, still whispering and darting looks back. Their soft, taunting laughter drifted back to Kaylah.

Master Geary gestured her through the gate after the older teenagers. “Have fun!”

She jutted out her chin.

*I’m not too small!*

#### Chapter 2: Ship Puncture

##### Scene 2.1: Puncture Alert

On the bridge a low-voiced conversation murmured behind Emmett as he waded through a drive failure sim. The captain raised his voice to ask, “Aria, status on the colonists?”

Emmett, half-listening to the conversation, watched streams of telemetry data from the sim.

Her lilting answer: “The musicians have taken the stage.”

Data in red suddenly swallowed the lower right quadrant of the giant viewscreen. Emmett frowned. His hands moved faster.

“Any incidents?”

“No, captain.”

“Monitoring?”

“I am tracking behavioral statistics within our established norms.”

“Thank you.”

The captain turned to the first mate to resume their conversation. Emmett’s simulation grew more intense, and he grinned. His fingers danced back and forth from holographic projection to the simulated controls below.

Emmett flicked his attention around the display windows, triple-checking, but everything lined up, the course correcting, the simulated ship settling to a steady motion. Nothing was missed.

The first mate raised his voice. “Stay the course, Mr. Emmett. You have 8 seconds remaining.”

“Yes, Mr. Davis.”

A growing irritation added a sour note to his enjoyment of the sim. Even after a year onboard, the crew still treated him as if he were ignorant or incompetent or something. It was getting old.

The simulation concluded, its results hovered mid-air as stars resumed their flow across the large viewscreen. He sat back and exhaled slowly. He had a moment before the next—

Alarms blared. Stars dissolved. Eerie red light played over the faces of the bridge crew.

“Rupture on tank 2, starboard. Rupture on tank 2, starboard.” Aria’s voice cascaded over the alarms.

The large viewscreen now displayed a section of a ship schematic pulsing red.

“What in the stellar?” Emmett murmured.

Alarms grew fainter.

Aria repeated melodically, “Rupture on tank 2, starboard.. This is not a drill. Tank rupture, tank—”

The engineer’s voice, clipped and strange, sounded in Emmett’s com. “Starboard water tank. Auto-plug did not engage. Repeat, did not engage.”

“Drone deployed.” Aria announced.

“On my way,” Already in motion, Mr. Davis was halfway to the bridge hatch. Emmett started to rise, still scanning telemetry.

“I have the bridge. Get moving!”

Emmett’s head whipped around. The captain stood at his right shoulder. “Yes, sir. You have the bridge.” Emmett launched himself across the room. Within seconds he was outside in the corridor, heading aft at a run.

##### Scene 2.2: Colonists' Trouble with Alert

Back in the rec hold, Kaylah collapsed on a bench, panting. After completing the obstacle course for the sixth time, she was exhausted. She wrinkled her nose as a scent of unwashed bodies rose up around her, including her own.

*A planet's fresh air -- even with smelly livestock -- wouldn't be so bad right now. This trip is taking forever! Maybe someday the Supralight drives on the high-end ships will cost much less. Or a wormhole. Wormhole travel would be so stellar. But, ugh, sheep!*

She shook her head in disgust.

*Stupid animals. I don’t want to spend my life shoveling manure from sheep or horses or whatever. Okay, horses. They’re fun to ride. But not as fun as star systems. Astrophysics over husbandry. Husbandry. That’s a weird word.*

She ignored the trickle of sweat that dripped down her face.

*Husbandry. Cultivation of animals. Ugh. Oooh, I think I’m going finish that project before Heinlein station. My old professor is going to be so pleased. It’s going to be so cool to have better data to navigate out here. And he thinks possibly 30% decrease? In transit times? Wow!*

Across the hold Master Geary spoke to an older man who often led the lessons.

*The grandmaster, I think? They’re not in our sleeping cabin.* She sighed. *At least there’s SOME people I haven’t bothered with my nightmare. Why can’t I just have quiet reactions? I should be used to that awful death ship by now.*

Master Geary bowed to the older man, then strode over to a table where her grandmother sat reading.

*Uh-oh.*

She rubbed at sudden goosebumps on her arms.

*Did I do something wrong?*

A few minutes later, her grandmother returned to her reading, and Master Geary approached with an encouraging smile. “You did very well on the course for your age.”

*He sounds like he’s talking to a kindergartner. Why do people treat me like I’m six?*

“Uh…” She ducked her head and whispered, “Thank you.”

“I spoke to your grandmother and the Grandmaster about you training with us. Would you like that?”

She jerked her head up and smiled. “Sure! That would be great! Tuesday and Thursdays, right? I’ve never really done sports, but karate looks so cool. Will I—“

Alarms blared.

All held motionless for an interminable moment. Then, everyone surged for the door as one. The mass of people carried Kaylah along, crowding her, looming over her. In the dull glow of the emergency lights she fought to keep on her feet.

*Maybe this drill will go better?*

##### Scene 2.3: Puncture Analysis

The drone cam shot out of the second starboard pot. Shimmering light from the FTL bubble danced and shivered in the video feed. Inside from a narrow alcove Mr. Davis and Emmett watched the drone start its journey down the side of the hull. Huddled over the drone’s manual overrides, Emmett flexed his hands, ready to pounce.

“Be ready for manual override,” murmured the first mate, unnecessarily. “Sometimes flying these drones in FTL can be… tricky. You need to be on-guard.”

Emmett nodded slightly, his attention on the screen. The first mate leaned over Emmett’s shoulder, tracking the drone’s progress in the small display.

“See how the drone’s programmed to hug the hull?”

“Yes, sir.”

Together they watched the feed. Emmett’s stomach clenched and twisted in anticipation.

Abruptly, the screen was filled with glittering shards and sparkles.

“Ice crystals,” Mr. Davis informed Emmett.

The drone powered through the cloud of ice particles to the water tank. It began to pass back and forth around the cylindrical surface.

“Found it!” Emmett crowed a few minutes later.

The steady pan of the now-hovering drone’s camera showed ragged ice jutting from a hole the size of a man’s fist. The drone circled around the ice spire while the camera zoomed in on the puncture. The damage seemed isolated.

Clicking his com, Mr. Davis announced, “Captain, we have visual confirmation on a class 3 puncture, along with quite a cloud of ice.”

“Copy. I see it.”

The drone continued on with nothing but smooth hull. The telemetry changed to green below the feed.

The engineer’s voice reached them. “Captain.”

“Go ahead, Scully.”

“Confirmed. The auto-sealant failed to plug the hole. Additionally, the #6 automated robot plug did not respond.”

On the open com, silence. Emmett could almost hear the captain’s jaw clench.

“Fault protection,” one of Emmett’s instructors had lectured back on Arsizio, “typically covers single-point and double-point failure.” When someone had asked about triple-point failure, the instructor had shrugged. “Less likely, and too expensive.”

Emmett huffed. His mind raced, sorting through possible additional complications and probabilities and contingencies. The water stops would need to be changed.

“Scully, I show 25% of the water remaining in that tank. Correct?” The captain’s voice stabbed into the com.

“Confirmed, sir.” The engineer’s clipped tones were easing back to his characteristic drawl. “And the ice is holding as a plug for now.”

Emmett watched as the drone curved back along the hull.

Aria chimed in. “Captain, I instructed one of the port robot plugs to move to the starboard tank. It is almost in-place. Full diagnostics are running.”

“Aria, thank you. Emmett, telemetry report. Keep me posted. Davis, make sure this plug works. Crew, resume normal operations.” He paused. “Briefing. One hour. Captain out.”

As he monitored the drone’s return flight to its bay, Emmett's fingers twitching slightly in anticipation of disaster, but the drone made it safely back.

“Well, it could have been worse.”

The voice startled Emmett. He blinked. 

Mr. Davis straightened away from the opposite wall of the narrow corridor. “Go get cleaned up.”

“Yes, sir.” Adrenalin fading, Emmett grimaced and pushed himself smoothly out of his crouch, taking a moment to stretch stiff muscles. He reeked from nervous sweat, yet Mr. Davis remained cool and immaculate.

“Get to it, Mr. Emmett. You’ve got a water analysis to prepare.”

“Yes, sir!” He dashed away down the corridor.

##### Scene 2.4 Puncture Debrief

An hour later, after using the 'fresher in his cabin, his brown hair threatening to bounce free of the order imposed on it, Emmett headed forward.

The captain held official crew briefings in the crew mess, a space barely large enough to fit everyone. The cramped cabin contained a small galley kitchen and a narrow oval table between the counters and the door.

He arrived early, but the others had already gathered around the table. Both Captain Brio and Mr. Davis were in their customary spots — the captain, standing with his back to the galley cabinets; the first mate, leaning against the wall next to the hatch. Mr. Davis waved Emmett over to the remaining empty stool.

“Alright.” The captain’s voice still occasionally caught Emmett off-guard, so similar to his favorite childhood uncle, yet so stern. “Scully, is the replacement plug in and holding?”

“Yes sir,” replied the engineer.

“Any additional damage?”

“No, captain.”

“The auto-sealant?”

“Most of the starboard auto-sealant is gone, blown out of the puncture. From what I can tell, it’s a defective batch from the factory,” Scully replied.

“Anastar Limited?” The captain growled.

The engineer’s voice drawled, “Again, yes. I—“

“We need to replace the sealant.”

“Yes, sir. Already whipping up a homemade ba—”

“And the auto-plug?” the captain demanded.

“Dead as an armadillo on a Texas highway.”

Even after a year into the trip, Emmett still couldn’t decide if if Scully’s aphorisms were natural or for fun. Or both.

The staccato barrage continued. “Last maintenance check?”

“Two months ago on the usual schedule. We found no sign of a problem.”

A vein throbbed at the captain’s temple. “Increase the frequency. Especially on Anastar parts.”

“Yes, sir.”

As he glared at the room at large, Captain Brio demanded, “How much water lost?”

“Enough,” Mr. Davis replied, his voice low and calm. “I’ve conferred with Mr. Fishing. According to our analysis, waiting until the planned Alpha stop, even with maximum water rationing, is no longer an option.”

Ren, the cargomaster, pursed his lips in a silent whistle.

Especially on transports like theirs, interstellar travel required careful planning, balancing the need for water collection against the delays the stops added. Any alteration to the plan would domino, affecting the rest of the transit to the colony world, even to the point of adding months to the trip, depending on the new stop’s rating. For a moment Emmett envied the interstellar liners that could afford the tech to make water from gasses collected while in transit.

“Mr. Emmett!” the captain barked. “The next beta site?”

“Yes, sir!” Emmett leaned forward, one brown curl flopping.“The closest watering hole, a beta water stop, is rated a Vorkos four.”

Because of the critical need for water, early interstellar survey and mapping teams had focused efforts on finding water sources. Fortunately for the human diaspora, ice turned out to be plentiful enough in most systems, and the Vorkos scale had been developed to rate the usability of each water site.

Scully waggled a warning finger at Emmett. “As far as we know with the latest data we have.”

Grim nods around the room acknowledged his statement. Ren, the cargomaster, looked paler than usual.

“Yes, sir.” Of course it depended on the data. Emmett’s instructors had harped on it, as had the crew during his sojourn on the Brio. So many reasons had been found to not to count on water being where you expected, sometimes the ice at a water stop would disappear through tectonic action, meteor strikes, or for a host of other reasons; sometimes ice at depths below the most recent sampling could contain higher levels of contaminants than it made sense for a ship to filter.

“You have the latest open-source databases?” the captain asked.

Emmett answered, “Yes, from our last download from Earth, and we’re carrying a baseline version in the vault as well.” Grass-roots movements had created open-source databases of water stops early in interstellar travel, becoming second in importance only to the star navigation data.

“Switch to a contingency plan using the beta water stop. I want to see the new plan. 23:00,” the captain ordered.

Emmett stood and headed for the door.

“After,” said Captain Brio irritably, waving Emmett back to his seat. “Davis! The passengers.”

The first mate grimaced. “All of the colonists made it to a pod this time—“

Faint sighs of relief came from around the room.

“But they still panicked. Aria graded the drill at 47%.”

The cargo master covered his face with one large, meaty palm and groaned.

“At least the failure score wasn’t 22% this time. We only had a few cuts and bruises and one sprained elbow.”

“And I handled the injuries promptly,” the doctor stated smugly. “My preparations do not fail.” He added, “Bah! The colonists are sheep. They cannot handle a simple ex—”

“Doctor!” the captain thundered.

The room became very quiet.

Captain Brio placed both hands on the table and leaned in. Each phrase was punctuated. “You will not. Denigrate. The passengers.”

In the silence the captain’s stare battered the doctor until he shifted uneasily and looked away.

Mr. Davis and Captain Brio exchanged a brief look.

The first mate said, calmly, “Those of us involved in interstellar commerce value customers and cargo.” His voice hardened. “Or we find ourselves unemployed dirtside.”

Emmett’s eyes narrowed. Maybe others found the doctor as offensive and incompetent as he did.

“Davis, ten months is long enough for a gentle ramp-up for our guests. Have you talked with the A.D. about encouraging more physical exercise among the passengers?”

“Yes, captain.”

“Good. Then, you and Scully go ahead with the second phase of drills. Make them as… efficient as possible in educating our passengers. I want to see a 15% improvement by the end of the week.”

“Yes, sir.”

“Mr. Emmett!”

Emmett straightened. “Yes, Captain Brio?”

“Your time from bridge to the starboard controls was over two minutes. Unacceptable. Davis, add more timed drills around the ship to Mr. Emmett’s training.”

Mr. Davis’ “Yes, captain” was echoed quietly by Emmett. Confused, his thoughts whirled. He had been practicing moving around the ship expeditiously even before launch. How he could possibly improve his time? More aerobic workouts?

“…help Mr. Davis and Scully.”

“Yes, sir,”Emmett acknowledged.

The captain paused. With a slightly warmer tone, he inquired, “Mr. Emmett? How goes your work? Your studies?”

“I’m continuing simulations and training at nav, and I’ve been increasing my time in my secondary duties. And I’m through the level three of the curriculum you assigned.”

“Good. Start on the fourth as soon as your duties allow. Everyone, dismissed.”

\#

“Come to order!”

The assistant director’s voice blared through the ancient megaphone. “Come to order!”

*No one’s paying attention to her. She’s so calm about it. And she’s so… so.. Elegant.* Kaylah picked at the fraying sleeve of her parka, her breath puffing in the cold air.

The assistant director, the diminutive Mrs. Holang-Lee, stood near the back wall of the rec area, in front of a stack of crates, dressed in a slim-fitting white puff coat and matching white scarf with blue flowers. The straight black strands of her hair brushed against her face as she surveyed the crowd.

*Her scarf— it’s so pretty.* A yearning struck Kaylah. *I wouldn’t mind something pretty*. Her grandmother wasn’t really into fashion, not that they had the money anyways. *Clothes don’t matter. Clothes don’t matter. Clothes don’t matter.*

“Could I have your attention, please?”

Around Kaylah the colonists were filling the converted cargo hold, their excited voices adding to the clamor of the kitchen staff working furiously. A few latecomers entered and passed Kaylah’s nearly-hidden perch on a storage unit by the hatch. These days, she felt safer nearer the exit.

“Let’s come to order!”

A few latecomers pushed their way in. Excited conversations grew louder. Kaylah rubbed her ears absently. *Where is the director, anyway?* She scanned the crowd for the missing director and his hanger-ons. *Why does Mrs. Holang-Lee have to do all the work? Why doesn’t he ever show—*

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

*Ow.* She looked across the crowd. Mrs. Holang-Lee stood on top of a stack of crates against the steel wall on the far side of the hold. The A.D. clutched a shoe in her hand, ready to pound the wall again, as she fiercely glared at the crowd.

Silence pooled in the packed hold. Even the kitchen workers had halted their efforts.

*Awesome.* From her vantage point Kaylah could see the stunned looks across many of the colonists. Even Mr. Clarke’s mouth hung open like a drooling idiot. *Ewwww, crackers are falling out of his mouth. Gross!*

Mrs. Holang-Lee’s usually stoic expression held a new sternness. Her gaze raked the crowd.

“We lost water.”

Faces paled.

“Not much,” she reassured, her voice gentling. “We have enough to get us to a water stop.”

A man yelled, “Was that why—“

“Yes, Mr. Hamer,” interrupted Mrs. Holang-Lee. “For any of you who have not heard the news, the emergency was not a drill. A piece of debris punctured the starboard tank.”

A round of gasps rippled through the crowd. Beside her a young woman began weeping, and her husband wrapped a comforting arm around her shoulders.

In her lap Kaylah’s hands were twisting and wrapping around each other. *I guess— I guess— we’ve all been pretending space is really not that dangerous.* She hunched over, staring blindly at her hands.

“What object?” called a voice.

“I thought FTL prevented collisions!” yelled another.

*Ha! It’s like they remember nothing! Even after all those training sessions back on Earth, and on ship.*

Mrs. Holang-Lee raised her voice. “People, I’m not finished. Yes, it’s rare for debris to be present inside an FTL bubble, but it happens. But on to the main topic – this incident has proved we are not sufficiently prepared for emergencies.”

*That’s an understatement.*

“We are colonists, not spacemen!” A thin, tall man cried out.

“They prefer to be called ‘crew’, Mr. Abeeku,” responded Mrs. Holang-Lee patiently.

*It’s like he’s read too much ancient science fiction.* Kaylah chuckled out loud. A colonist leaning on the crates near her, one from their passenger cabin, cast an unfriendly look Kaylah’s way. Kaylah sank back into the shadow of the crate next to her.

Mrs. Holang-Lee had raised her voice. “As all of our lives depend on the crew, let’s show a little respect.”

A few feet away stood Mr. Clarke, with some crumbs still stuck on his chin. He now was glaring at her, and his glare was… She shrank back further against the wall. *I can’t help it! The nightmares just happen! Why does everyone hate me?*

Both her hands gripped each other now in a death grip.

The assistant director continued, “The captain has arranged for a more intensive training and drilling program. We start tomorrow morning. Everyone will participate.”

Groans and muttered complaints met her remarks.

Mrs. Holang-Lee said, “The crew have worked hard to improve the training. I’m asking you to try your best.” Her intent gaze drilled the crowd. “There are worse accidents than a punctured water tank.”

### Episode 2: Friends, Emotions, and Ship Drills

#### Chapter 3: Friends and Foes

##### Scene 3.1: Foe and Friend

A month later, colonists of first shift were eating breakfast. Voices from scattered conversations, clanks and preparations in the kitchen, and the irregular shushing from the ventilation fans made an annoying backdrop. Kaylah rubbed an ear as she stared at yet another bowl of oatmeal.

“Hey, Kaylah.” She looked up to see Jonah’s friendly countenance, his arm around his girlfriend, Amy, who smiled sweetly. The teen couple tended to avoid the cliques that were so nasty to Kaylah, and the two never had a harsh word for anyone. *Even me, with these stupid nightmares bothering everyone and making them mad.*

“Those were some drills, ey?” said Jonah.

“Uh-huh.” She asked, staring down at her spoon, “Amy, are the animals okay? Like, after the puncture and everything.” She peeked up at the taller girl through her eyelashes before staring at her bowl again.

“They’re fine. One of the horses foaled. You should come see it.”

Kaylah looked up and smiled. “I thought what little stock we brought live — I mean, instead of embryo… They were going to wait until landfall to have baby livestock, right? What happened? Did they change their minds? How did—”

“Good questions,” laughed Amy. “You should see him, though. He’s the cutest thing.”

Jonah whispered in Amy’s ear, and she nodded. “We’ll see you later, okay, Kaylah?”

The two made their way through the crowd of colonists toward the exit. Jonah’s hand rested in the small of Amy’s back. 

*They make a cute couple.*

Absently rubbing her ear again with one hand, Kaylah resumed pushing a spoon around the gray mass of oatmeal in her bowl. *Ugh!*

Most of the off-shift colonists were crammed into the converted cargo hold, and the tables around Kaylah were packed. Vehement complaints about the ship drills and rounds of gossip floated in the air. Behind Kaylah two colonists grumbled over their food, something about hot food or hot water or hot something. At the table next to her several colonists were complaining about bruises received in the last set of drills.

*Everyone sounds unhappy. Nervous, maybe?* She swallowed a bit of oatmeal absently, with a frown. *It’s still such a long way to go to get to Perth. And, then, sheep. And cows. And whatever other animals. Manure. Lots of manure.* She sighed. *Like I have a choice.*

Mrs. Holang-Lee said people over the course of the trip would become “irascible” and that “The psychological effects of a long interstellar trip could be alleviated but not eradicated.”

Kaylah liked the assistant director.

*She’s not afraid to use her vocabulary. Are the new drills helping? I’m not sure they are. Yet.*

She didn’t want anyone else to get hurt. *Although I didn’t know I would be so... good? And Master Geary says I have a quick reaction time?* She paused stirring her oatmeal. *I just wish… wish I wasn’t so different. With what I know. And the nightmares!* 

Like it was conjured, the death ship, a wreck of metal and death, swamped her. The spoon clattered into her bowl. Her hands fell to her lap, and clenched. 

*No, no, no. Why does this keep happening?*

She fought off the images.  *It’s cold in here. Worse than usual.*

She huddled into her parka, pulling it tighter to her small frame. Her grandmother sat next to her, reading. 

Next table over, a group of teenagers joked, ignoring Kaylah except for an occasional snarky remark or snide glance. 

*Everybody hates me.* 

She slumped in her chair, tugging on the fraying ends of her parka’s sleeve, before forcing another bite of oatmeal. As she forced her spoon through the sludge in the bowl, she felt someone watching her.

It was Mr. Clarke. Glaring at her. Another colonist at his table, following his gaze, leaned over to whisper to her companion.

All the eyes watching her. The smells of the unwashed drifting around her. The sounds in the hold. She dropped the spoon again, and shoved at the tray, choking back a sob.

*It’s not my fault! And I can’t help crying. That death ship is so awful. It scares me. These nightmares, they’re horrible. But I’m not as loud as I used to be, and it’s only happening, like, maybe once a week. Okay, twice a week now. They don’t have to live with those— those awful images!*

She stood abruptly. “Grandma?”

“Hmmm?”

“I’m leaving now.”

“Finish your food.”

“But Grandma—“

“Finish.” Her grandmother returned to her book. Kaylah thumped back into her seat, knocking into the table. It shook, spilling food off the fork of one of the biologists across the table. The older man eyed her with disfavor. She could hear someone snickering behind her.

It was all too much. Grabbing her tray, she scurried over to the kitchen to thrust it against the pile there. Her need to escape driving her, her grandmother’s reprimands chasing her, she fled. Through the crowd, head down, ducking around incoming groups of colonists, she headed for the corridor.

There, the clamor of the colonists followed her. She started to run.

“Walk, don’t run!” A passing colonist yelled after her.

With a nervous glance over her shoulder, she slowed to a brisk walk. *Grandma’s going to be so mad. I’m so going to get it. But I don’t care!*

In minutes she made it to a less-used section of the ship. 

Here, the floor grates rattled louder with each footfall. Although spotless, the scuffed and scratched corridor showed its age. She tipped her head back and squinted in the dimness overhead at a series of grates. Several of the conduits behind the grates taped together with what looked like duct tape.

“A budget ride is a budget ride,” a family friend had warned as they said their last goodbyes on Earth. He had added earnestly, “but Brio’s Hope will get you there in one piece. .”

*In one piece.*

The image of the broken derelict seized her mind.

Frozen. Cold. Deathly.

She wrenched her mind away from the nightmare and focused on the silence around her. Here, in the stern of the ship, the corridor enclosed by the water tanks, the only sounds were her footfalls and the occasional rattle of metal beneath her feet.

Kaylah pulled her old parka tighter over the broken zipper. Her breath hung visible in the still air.

*Fans must be off again.*

Despite the musty odor, it smelled better than the rec area. Too many people. *And the stink! Ugh!* Her nose crinkled in disgust. *Water rationing. Ugh.* She understood why they rationed water. She just didn’t like it.

Kaylah was not really supposed to be in the corridors outside the designated passenger area. Last year, the crew conducting the pre-launch briefing had warned against traveling around the ship unless necessary. 

One had added, looking directly at Kaylah, “Especially the children.”

*Children?* She snorted. *I’m fourteen. Well, almost.*

So far, eleven months into the trip, despite the initial warning and the ubiquitous security cams, no one had stopped her from traveling around the ship, not even her father. 

On one of the first days out he had said, “Precious-precocious,” – he had no clue of the negative Lord of the Rings connotation – “we are gonna allow you to go about on your own here on the ship.” 

He had expected her to get herself to and from work, the cafeteria, and their berths, and to make some friends.

And she had, more or less.

Her steps quickened. *Almost there!*

##### Scene 3.2: Meeting Aria

She slid into the rickety seat with a sigh of comfort. Here, the air tasted cleaner, and the light illuminating the workstation gave a cozy glow. It had taken her months of cautious exploration to find this alcove, but it was perfect. 

*Yes! Alone. No one to whisper about me. No one being nasty.*

In a few minutes the world around her had faded. She plowed into the data, her favorite instrumental music pouring through her earbuds, her fingers flying. Curves and plots and points danced on the display in time with the clicking of the keys on the ancient keyboard and the tempo of the music. 

Her eyes sparkled. *Data is so much easier than people.* 

She finished several more sections of data while cozy light overhead continued to shine like a benediction. Time passed.

Gradually, in her earbuds Kaylah heard singing overlaying the current movement.

*What??*

Her fingers slowed.

Soon, she could pick out words. 

A mezzo-soprano was singing, “Hello, hello, hello.” The voice increased in volume. “Isss this a goooood time to ta-ah-ah-ah-ah-lk?”

“Um, sure?” she mumbled around a fist that had found her mouth.

“Gooooood, good, good,” the voice sang in response as Kaylah’s music faded away.

Recognition flared, and her arms waved wildly in excitement, “Oh, you’re… you’re… the ship AI!” The tips of Kaylah’s feet, which barely reached the floor, started tapping the floor in quick staccato. “What’s your name?”

By now her earbuds played only the fading sounds of stringed instruments.

“Na-a-ame?” the AI sang. “Ar----ee--ah! Ar--ee--ah! Ar--ee--ah!”

“That’s appropriate, I suppose.” Kaylah’s grin widened. A musical AI? Cool! “Glad to meet you!”

“You-uuuu like music?” the AI queried.

“Yes, it helps me think when I’m doing analysis.”

“You study the stars?” Aria asked. Now that the orchestra had faded completely, the AI’s melodic voice settled into a regular speech cadence.

“Yes, for years. Since I was five. I’m Kaylah. We’re heading to Perth to ranch and farm and whatever. We, that’s me, my dad, and my grandmother. My dad still calls me precious-precocious, even though I’m fourteen.” She rolled her eyes.

“I use the stars.”

“Oh? You’re the navigational computer? How long have you been aboard? What’s your music specialty? What generation are you? Where are you from? You’re the first music AI I’ve met. What kind of music background do you have? Are you accessible to everyone? Are you the only AI—“

“You have data, much of it?” Aria asked.

“Well, yes, I’m trying to arrange it now so I can analyze the spectroscopy data different ways.”

“Why?”

Kaylah grinned. “You are a data-collecting girl, aren’t you, Aria?”

Aria’s voice became a flat, pedantic monotone, contrasting sharply with her previous speech. “Girl? I. Am. Not a. Girl. I. am. an artificially. Intelligent…”

Aria paused.

“Woman.”

With the last word her voice slid back into its melodic lilt.

Somehow this was so funny to Kaylah, she burst out in loud whoops of laughter for several minutes until they devolved into giggles. 

*Oh, I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time.*

Still chuckling, Kaylah said, “Well, anyway, I’m hoping this project will help with navigation, and maybe even find more exo-planets. Getting us going where we’re going safer. Finding new places for people to live.” By now her hands were sweeping the air as they accompanied her words. “Giving back to those who got us here. And it’s kinda my way of exploring. It’s a lot do. And I have to finish before landfall, so I can send it back to Earth. The ship has the bandwidth; the colony does not and will not. No bandwidth for non-essentials. Non-essentials meaning beyond what the colony needs to survive. And—“

“May I assist?”

“That would be great! That would really help. I think we could finish by landfall. Are you sure you’re not busy? This is really cool. Do you want to use—“

A holographic projection jumped into existence, inches from her nose.

“Eek!” She jerked back. The chair wobbled precariously under her.

“Manual controls are enabled,” Aria announced.

Speechless for once, Kaylah stood hesitantly, then placed tentative hands around the columnar projection. With cautious moves she rotated the model, then gestured to zoom-in on a quadrant. With delight her hands started to dance, faster and faster, with graphs expanding, contracting, and changing in flashing images. Within minutes Kaylah had completely immersed herself in a comparison analysis and discussion with Aria.

A soft tone interrupted. Then another. Finally, Aria said, “Your alarm is for your appointment, correct?”

“Ugh! The doctor!” She pirouetted and started jogging down the corridor. “I’m late!”

##### Scene 3.3: The Doctor Appointment

“Do I have to?” Kaylah shuffled her feet, walking slower and slower down the corridor.

“Yes, you have to.” Her grandmother strode on. “We just want to make sure that you’re okay. These nightmares…” She looked back at Kaylah. “Come on,” she said impatiently. “Look, I think it’s anemia. Your great-grandmother had it. I think it’s affecting your dreams. I told the doctor I wanted him to check your blood.”

*Ugh. Blood sampling. It’s like vampires.* And she had never been crazy about vampire novels or movies. *Another thing that makes me weird. I was so excited when we first came aboard. Now these nightmares are ruining everything!*

“He was eager to help,” continued her grandmother.

*Oh, great, probably ‘cause of people complaining about me and the nightmare.* An image of the derelict flashed, and she shuddered.

“Come on, Kaylah,” said her grandmother again, impatiently.

A few minutes later they reached the medbay just at the edge of the crew ring of the ship. Rather than enter the med bay, her grandmother leaned against a corridor wall next to the entrance.

“You’re not coming in with me?”

“No, you’ll be fine.” Her grandmother pulled out her reader.

With one last look at her grandmother now absorbed in reading, Kaylah trudged inside.

Soon she found herself in a hard metal chair. The doctor loomed over her, a tablet in his hand. Set too close in a plump face, his cold eyes drilled into hers.

“So, Kili, want a treat?” He extended a pudgy hand holding a jar of lollipops.

*My name is Kaylah*. She shook her head. *Does he think I’m three? I turned fourteen just last month!*

A flicker of a frown crossed his face. “Suit yourself.”

They were not alone in the cramped medical bay; beyond the doctor the medical assistant checked supplies with deft, efficient movements.

He looked familiar.  The man had short hair that spiked up and curled in the oddest directions. He seemed very efficient and professional, yet, when he had glanced her way…

*He seems friendly. More than the doctor, anyway. I remember him from the crew introductions. I wonder what—*

“How are you enjoying your trip so far?” The doctor offered a false smile.

“It’s okay,” she said softly. *I wish Grandma had come in with me.*

“It can be scary leaving home for some people.” With a fake warmth, he leaned forward and pressed his hands together at the fingertips.

*Who does that thing with their hands?*

“It’s no big deal.” She shifted uneasily.

“Do you miss Earth?”

*Well, duh, it was my home, all I ever knew*. She shrugged.

Behind the doctor the assistant medic looked over his shoulder at her and rolled his eyes. Her mouth twitched a little, and the burning in her stomach eased.

The doctor continued, “Space is really big. Does it bother you?”

“No.” *What, he can’t use big words? Wait-- didn’t he even check my file?*

“How about ship life? Others onboard?” He asked, once more scrutinizing the tablet in front of him.

The lights overhead were so bright.

*Why is he asking about that stuff? If I say anything bad at all, will the doctor tell anybody? I don’t want more trouble. The director already doesn’t like Dad, and that rich professor snubbed Grandma – I know we don’t have much money compared to them, and those teenagers don’t like me, and—*

The doctor impatiently tapped a finger on the edge of the tablet.

Strands of panic shot through her. “Fine,” she finally replied.  

In her lap her hands tightened and twisted against each other as she added, with forced enthusiasm, “I like that I can spend so much time studying.”

He tapped on the tablet, then nodded without looking up.

Prompted by nervous desperation, words rushed out. “I’m getting to know such different people onboard. I’ve met a few from the next cabin over, and I met a boy named Jonah and his girlfriend Amy”

“Yes, yes,” he interrupted, still looking at his tablet. “What about living on a colony world?”

She swallowed, her throat tight, then exclaimed a little too loudly, “Life on another planet? It is going to be great!”

The doctor nodded again at his tablet, with a twisted grimace.

She had considered the trip to the new planet one big adventure -- until the nightmare. *The nightmare*. She swallowed hard, feelings of panic rising.

The doctor caught her expression and pounced. “What are you worried about?”

“N-n-nothing!”  *He knows about the nightmares. Of course he does. But, I don’t want trouble.*

She tried to take a deep breath, but her chest felt so tight.

The doctor thumped into a chair and drummed his fingers against the arm rest, all the while staring coldly at her.

Her breathe became short, shallow puffs.

“Now, Kyli…” He reached out to pat her hand with a cool, obnoxiously soft touch.

Behind the doctor the medic had stilled, one hand on a box of supplies. He wore a frown and an air of concentration, as if listening intently, as if watching circumspectly Somehow, she found it comforting.

“If you’re not prepared to engage in counseling, we can try other therapies.” The doctor’s oily voice carried a threatening undertone.

*Counseling? This is counseling? I thought I was here for an exam!* She studied her hands, each pressed tightly around the other, with whitened knuckles.

“Bernston and Gupta have had good success with medication for people like you.”

*People like me? What?*

“I really—“

“Several medications are possibilities.”

“I really don’t like medicines, sir.”

“If you’re willing to be cooperative…”

Still struggling to breathe, she swallowed hard. “Cooperative?” she said, her voice pitching higher on the last syllable. “What do you want me to do?”

“First, let’s try a tranquilizer.” Ticking off the options on his fingers, the doctor continued. ”Then more counseling, and then—“

A chime interrupted.

“What now?”

Deferentially, the medic answered. “I think that’s for the meeting with the captain, sir? In 5 minutes?”

“Yes, yes, of course.” Pinning Kaylah once again with his beady gaze, the doctor pulled a prescription bottle from his pocket. “It is called a tranquilizer. Take one each evening at with your meal.”

The pill bottle rested in her palm, innocuous and small. *Okay… It’s no big deal. And anything that helps me be quiet at night. No big deal.*

The doctor moved toward the door and looked back over his shoulder. “I will determine what future treatment is best for you.”

With that ominous statement, he left. With a soft hiss the door shut behind him. The burning in her stomach eased slightly. She looked up from the pill bottle to find the medic standing in front of her.

“I’m Emmett.” He extended his hand, and she shook it awkwardly, her eyes lowering to the floor.

“I remember. From pre-launch stuff.”

“That’s right. If you have any questions or problems with the medication, let me know, okay?”

She darted a a look at him, then turning the pill bottle around in her hands.

“Come on,” he said, “I’ll escort you out.”

She raised head to look at him, then at the exit hatch, just five steps away, then back at him. The corners of her mouth turned up briefly.

Outside in the corridor as she turned to meet her grandmother, he called after her, “It will be alright.”

*It will be alright. It will.* The fierceness of her thoughts pushed her fears down deep.

#### Chapter 4: Space Travel is Dangerous

##### Scene 4.1: Emotional Processing

Weeks passed. Once again the alcove’s overhead light cast a friendly glow over Kaylah. As she attempted to make up for time lost on the project, her gloved fingers clicked and clacked over the ancient keyboard. The opera playing through her earbuds slipped into a Brahms sonata.

Her fingers fumbled, and her graph projection collapsed.

“Argh!” She rubbed her eyes. *I hope Aria can help soon.* Her project was falling further behind from where she had planned. *And people are getting weirder.*

The long trip wore on everyone’s nerves, she guessed. *But no one else is a freak like me. And I can’t even get this stupid analysis done.* She shook her head. *Work, brain, work!* Thinking was so hard lately.  *Will I ever finish?? Before we get to Perth?*

For the next half hour she struggled to collate more data on the star catalog. In the middle of ninth data set, her fingers lagged once again, this time as thoughts of her interview with the doctor intruded. She wished her grandmother had gone in with her.

“I was scared,” she said in a small voice. *Still am, for that matter.* She took a deep breath. And another.

“What a sleaze!” She punched a key repeatedly, making the next plot jerk and tremble. “Did he think I was six, not fourteen?” Her voice echoed off the steel wall behind the workstation.

*And that smarmy smile!* Beneath her the chair creaked as she rocked back and forth. *That question about space.*

She snorted. “There’s no way he read my file!” She swung a foot back and forth and raked her fingers through her hair. *There’s the camps, and the fairs, and the competitions...* Most kids she knew had never even been above 30,000 feet. She couldn’t remember a time when she didn’t love space exploration and space travel and astronomy and navigation and anything related to space. And now here she was, on a ship plunging through a vast blackness with stars twinkling between, the nebulae, planets with rings, asteroid belts…

*Not that there’s anywhere to actually see space here, anyways. The ship’s just a large tin can. A budget ride.*  She stilled. *A budget ride. Maybe… maybe he’s a budget doctor. Will… will he really make me do that treatment stuff?*

Nervously her fingers twitched up the volume on the symphony playing through her earbuds. She pushed away disturbing thoughts and turned back with clumsy fingers to the keyboard and her project.

*I will get this done.*

##### Scene 4.2: Ship Drill (Ship Thread)

“Don’t trust the sensors,” drawled the engineer, Scully.

Overhead the bulk of the star drives loomed, their presence a pressing weight of immensity and vibration. The roaring penetrated to Emmett’s bones.

“Yes, sir.” Emmett rolled his tongue around his internal com absentmindedly.

The two were crouched over a display. Machinery, pipe, and ductwork wrapped around them. Despite the immensity of the compartment, every last cubic meter was used, with human access pushed in like an afterthought.

“Acmetel makes crappy sensors. They’re not worth a pile of chicken excrement. They error out about once a…”

Emmett nodded his head, only half-listening, his gaze tracing convoluted runs of pipes and conduit around them.

“…so don’t assume the AI is right,” continued Scully.

“Yes, sir,” he replied automatically. It was what Emmett had heard over and over growing up, at school and at home, not to make assumptions, to pay attention to detail. His aunt had harped on it enough, as had the retired ship-goers who taught at the university.

An alarm started beeping. The display shifted to show an area flashing yellow.

“…and there’s a sensor error!” Scully said, disgusted. He pulled a sealed package out of his utilities. “Here, take this.”

Emmett examined it. “The sensor?”

Scully nodded. “Follow me.” He backed out of the niche, contorting his body around conduit to reach the handhold. Chinning himself up via the handhold, he then swung onto a large pipe and began climbing up. Emmett followed.

They reached the sensor, and Emmett replaced it, with Scully scrutinizing his every move. Once done, they climbed higher, closer to the drives. The intensity of the vibrations here made Emmett’s bones ache.

Scully drawled, “Now, the drives sometimes have abnormal variations. One time out of Cobb station…”

Droning on, the engineer began telling another of what Emmett thought of as “scare-the-new-guy” stories.

The crew bombarded Emmett with at least a dozen of these kinds of stories a week, even Captain Brio. What’s worse, any crisis-laden story had a high probability of ending up in his next onboard training sim. With the thousands and thousands of sims during school and onboard, Emmett knew he could catch and handle each and every problem.

When Scully had wound down telling his current disaster story, Emmett spoke. “Sir? Anything else before I leave for my cleaning assignment?”

“Well, no. Get yourself down there.”

Emmett wormed his way around conduit and other drive components to take the narrow catwalk and ladder to the rear of the drive compartment. As he headed astern, Emmett passed the passenger quarters and cargo holds to finally reach a cylindrical hatch. Unlocking the hatch, he ducked through.

Dim lights flickered on, illuminating curved metal walls extending into darkness. While he waited, he put one hand on the smooth metal, envisioning the giant struts just outside, encasing the tube and holding the water tanks fast to the body of Brio’s Hope, then the shimmer of the FTL bubble, then the vastness of space around Brio’s Hope, the systems, the star formations, the expanse of blackness…

From down the corridor a series of tapping sounds came closer and closer, accompanied by tiny green lights that swirled in a spiral around the tube toward him. Soon he could pick out of the gloom the actual bodies of the centipede-like robots, spiraling ever closer around the corridor walls, the cleaning brushes sweeping around conduit and pipe. A moment more, and they streamed around him on their way to their charging niche.

Emmett dogged the hatch after them. “Start from the far end,” he repeated his instructions aloud to hear his own voice in the silence. He jogged down to the very stern of the ship, pulled supplies from his utilities, and began cleaning the crevices inaccessible to the robots.

Despite not seeing the point of detailed cleaning in an area rarely accessed, Emmett did not mind his assignment. For a couple of hours, he could be alone, completely alone. Sometimes he mentally reviewed simulations, sometimes he composed texts to send back home. Sometimes, he just thought of nothing at all. Cleaning could be meditation, his aunt had said. He had not understood what she meant until several months into the journey.

Violins shrieked in alarm. Lights in the tube flashed red.

“Emergency stations. Code Yellow. Code Yellow. Code Yellow” Aria’s voice stridently sang over the shrieking.

Emmett ran.

##### Scene 4.3: Ship Drill (Kaylah Thread)

Down in the bowels of the ship, in her alcove, the blaring alarms startled Kaylah out of her chair. She staggered and crashed into the side of the chair.

*Ow!* She rubbed her hip. *Another drill?* Her forehead wrinkled. Probably. She limped away from the alcove. *Not another puncture?* She struggled against sluggishness and a rising tide of freezing panic, of fear.

*Think, Kaylah, think! Drills have covered this. Escape pod.*

She turned to head down the corridor her foot caught somehow on the grating. As if in slow motion but powerless to catch herself, she fell sideways. Her head hit the steel wall of the corridor with a sickening thud. She had one last impression of the ship lurching, of blinking yellow lights swimming and blurring in her vision.

Then nothing.

## Part 2: Struggles and Choices

### Episode 3

#### Chapter 5: After the Drill

##### Scene 5.1: Post-Drill

The floor grating, cold and rigid, pressed against her cheek.

Claxons still blared.

*Wha…?* Kaylah forced sticky eyelids to open. Red flashing lights lanced into her brain. *Ow!* She slammed her eyes shut in self-defense. Tears leaked out to dribble down her cheeks.

*Red lights?* The alarms continued to whoop, thudding inside her head like a tympani drum. Against the pain a thought tugged. She squinted open one reluctant eye, peering through gummed up eyelashes.

While the red lights flashed above, on the floor along the edge of the grating a trail of orange lights flickered to life in succession, then off and on again, as if encouraging her down the corridor. *Oh, a… drill. Go to… emergency pod…*

Trembling, she struggled to rise, the attempt causing such a rush of pain that her vision blurred. Her right hand stuck to the grating for a moment before relinquishing its hold.

She stared stupidly. It was covered in a viscous dark-colored liquid. *Blood. It’s blood.*

Around her alarms continued. Pain still synchronized with the beat of the alarms. *Ow-ooo!* She wiped her shaking hand futilely on her jeans.

*Okay, got to move*. She attempted to push off from the metal grating, but the pain swamped her.  The floor swam. Tears leaked through crusty eyelids.

On her third attempt, she made it to her feet. She staggered down the passageway, following the orange lights to where they ended.

“A pod!” she whispered, spiking another lance of pain through her skull. She half-fell into the small, coffin-shaped box and with a fumbling finger pressed the button to seal it shut.

##### Scene 5.2: Post-Drill Help

The red glow of the alarms pulsed. To Emmett, reaching the hatch at the end of the maintenance tube seemed to take lifetimes. At the tube’s end the telltales on the hatch were shifting from orange to green. He paused, his mind racing through different scenarios. No reports flooded his com. He needed data.

“Aria—”

“Drill only, drill only, Mr. Emmett.” Her voice deepened in his ear, the melodic quality rather martial in tone.

He sighed in relief.

She continued, “Please report to medbay.”

The telltales on the hatch shifted completely to green, and he carefully double-checked the hatch before unsealing it. He stepped through, turned, and re-latched the hatch firmly. He eyed the telltales from the other side until they shifted to red, then nodded his head at the faint clunk as the mechanism seated. Spinning around, he started jogging.

“Aria, on my way.”

The alarms pulsed in accompaniment to his footfalls, following him to the main corridor. When he reached the intersection with the branch leading to the rec hold, he found several dazed colonists piled on the floor.

In his ear, her voice softer and slower in cadence, Aria reported, “Drill ends now.” The alarms ceased, and the lights steadied to their usual dim glow.

The colonists were starting to move. An older man sat up, groaning.

“Get off me!” snapped an angry, female voice. “Get OFF!” A small fist pounded ineffectively on the arm of a rather large man slumped over her.

Emmett leaned over the two prone figures. From under the larger man, snapping black eyes met his in a glare.

“Mrs. Holang-Lee, hold still.” Emmett slid his med scanner from its pouch. “Let’s get you two checked out.”

After scanning the large man who had fallen over the diminutive Mrs. Holang-Lee, Emmett said lightly, “Aren’t you too big to be wrestling the assistant director?”

He offered a helping hand, but the larger man shoved Emmett’s hand away with a stream of profanity and pushed himself to his feet before shambling away.

Emmett exhaled slowly. The doctor would be irritated at the delay. 

He started scanning the rest of the colonists.

“What happened?” An older woman’s voice pitched upward hysterically as she scrambled up off the floor. “Another tank puncture? A decompression? Are we lost? Are we…”

“It’s okay, ma’am,” he reassured. “A drill only. It’s over now.”

“Don’t call me ma’am! A drill? A drill?!”

“Mrs. Oney, are you injured?”

She shook her head.

Making a note to follow up with another psych eval — the doctor loved those and would spent all his time dissecting the colonists’ minds if he could — Emmett finished scanning the older woman before turning back to a haggard Mrs. Holang-Lee, who still lay on her side on the floor, uncharacteristically silent.

“So, Assistant Director?” He held out a hand to help her up.

She started to rise from the floor, only to crumple, curling protectively over her forearm. Her face paled as a short gasp of pain escaped from her lips.

He kneeled beside her. “Let me see,” he said gently.

##### Scene 5.3: Post-Drill (Medbay)

Medbay was packed and reeked of sweat and fear. The sounds of the ventilation fans running full-force were not enough to clear the air, nor drown out the whispers and belligerence of the injured and frightened.

“About time!” the doctor snapped. “Get busy with triage!”

Emmett carefully eased Mrs. Holang-Lee against a wall, sandwiching her between two other colonists waiting to be treated.

Fortunately, no one suffered severe injury; Ms. Holang-Lee’s fractured ulna may have been the worst of the lot. That was an improvement over some of the earlier drills.

Examining the crowded cabin, Emmett felt a wave of futility. Depended on your definition of improving, he supposed. He swallowed hard. Would they actually make it to Perth? All of these poor souls?

“Mr. Emmett?” The tone of Aria’s voice ascended upwards in his ear.

“Yes?”

“A latch failure on emergency pod \#D302 trapped one colonist on ring 12.”

“Did the colonist say what happened?”

Aria paused. “No communication from the colonist.”

“Com failure or…” Emmett lowered his voice. “Colonist failure?” Uneasily, Emmett checked for listening ears, but the colonists seemed sunk in their own fear and pain, and the doctor wrapped in talking to a young teacher.

“Unknown.” Aria drew out the word in one melodic note.

“Doctor?”

“Yes?” the doctor snapped. “I’m busy.” The doctor’s gaze remained latched on the woman who now was edging subtly toward the door.

“Mrs. Holang-Lee has a fractured ulna.” He gestured at the assistant director. “I’ve field-treated it.”

“Yes, yes, I’ll get to it.” The doctor waved an irritated hand. “You, get to work.”

”Sorry, doctor.” Emmett tried to sound sincere. “I’ve got a call. I’ll check in later.” He was already in motion, adroitly maneuvering around the colonists packed into medbay to duck through the hatch.

“Aria, on my way.”

The doctor’s complaining voice chased him down the corridor.

##### Scene 5.4: Post-Drill (K Rescue)

Scattered across the ship, the bullet-shaped emergency pods rested in clamps against bulkheads. Despite rigorous training before and after launch on pod usage, the crew still struggled to convince the colonists to head to the pods promptly only when the emergency mandated their use. One of his family’s phrase, “herding cats”, came to mind.

This pod was positioned in a niche in a smaller corridor down near the cargo holds. When Emmett arrived, he frowned; the pod’s polycarbonate window showed an empty compartment.

Puzzled, he examined the pod. Dried on the latch was something… dried blood.

“Aria, you said someone was here?”

“Affirmative.”

Raising his voice, he called, “Anybody in there?”

Weak thumping came in response. A muffled voice yelled something unintelligible.

“Just a minute! I’ll get you out!” he shouted, trying the latch. It stuck. He angled for better pressure, and tried again. Still, it refused to move. Finally, he forced all of his weight onto the latch, one leg braced against the corner for additional leverage. The latch finally gave way, and the lid swung away.

A small figure tumbled out of the pod and collapsed on the grate, crying. It was the Broussard girl.

“Take it easy, child. It’ll be okay,” Emmett said in his best soothing tones. “It’ll be okay.”

“I’m… not a… child…” she mumbled.

“What did you say?” he asked. He scanned her for injuries.

“Never mind.” She pulled herself to a sitting position, wincing. “Ow. Ow, ow.”

“Definitely a concussion,” he told her. “The cut on your temple isn’t that bad. Just bled quite a bit. And your wrist is sprained.” Relieved it wasn’t worse, he applied the the quick-brace, then grabbed a few wipes from his kit. “We’ll get you cleaned up in no time, then we’ll get you to medbay.”

“Not the doctor!” Dismayed, she swiped at her tears with the back of her hand. She wobbled and tried to rise.

“Hey, hey, hey,” he said as he carefully placed an arm around her shoulder to help her stand. “No need for all the crying. You’re going to be okay.”

If the only child onboard had been badly injured… Emmett shuddered at the possibility. The mental stability of the colonists, not to mention what the captain would say.

“What happened?”

“I… I fell,” said Kaylah miserably.

“Surprising. I’ve heard you’re steady on your feet from the karate guys—” He shifted his arm to steady her as they walked.

“Ka—” She winced against a flash of pain through her skull. “Karate guys? That’s what you call them?”

“Sorry. What’s the preferred term?”

“Karate master. Karate student. Martial artists. Green—”

“Okay, okay.” He chuckled. “Got it. Anyways, last time I saw the metrics your response times were better than most adults.”

“Really? It is? Cool. I didn’t know you all tracked that many metrics. Some of the colonists really just sit around and don’t do a whole of anything.”

“You colonists are a mixed bunch, for sure.”

They shuffled on down the passageway. Emmett looked down at the little girl. “So, it was an accident?” Emmett returned to his enquiry. “You just fell?”

She shrugged, wincing again at the pain from the movement. “I guess.”

“Huh.”

“Why?” she asked.

“Just seems a little weird, based on the med metrics.”

She lifted her shoulders into a slight shrug, more careful this time.

“Well, let’s get you to medbay and cleaned up.”

She shuddered but made no further protest.

Her head hurt.

#### Chapter 6: Life Onboard

##### Scene 6.1: Decides to Model Vision

Brio’s Hope plunged on in the darkness. Weeks passed. One day Kaylah threw herself into her alcove, crashed into the chair, and banged her knee into the console.

“Ow!” As she rubbed her knee, a waterfall of words tumbled out. “Aria, what do you know about nightmares? How can I stop my nightmares? The sedation seems to be helping, but I don’t like taking pills. Uh… Maybe I can find some way to deal with them? The nightmares? So I don’t make so much noise? And my head feels funny. It’s hard to think. At least those horrible images from the nightmare don’t hurt like they did. But they’re still stuck in my brain. Well, the sedation is helping. It did. For awhile. And it still is, but it’s like the dreams are taking over, just, like, my brain is fragmenting or something. Fragments? And the jumble just keeps on. And I don’t need to get worse! I’m such a freak. Just don’t—”

Aria interjected, “Processing.”

“Oh.” Subsiding, Kaylah plopped down at the workstation. She stared blankly up at the lighting as her breath puffed in the cold air.

Her alcove, with its worn steel plating and the conduits and pipework, felt different today, more ominous… She shivered. *What’s wrong with me? I feel… off.*

“Your concussion?”

Kaylah threw a fake grin at the place where she usually imagined her friend to be.

“Oh, it’s long gone. The doctor and Mr. Emmett cleared me ages ago. Really, I’m all better. It’s all good. No need to see the doctor again. It’s—”

“Processing.”

Thoughts swirled around in Kaylah’s head, of the angry Mr. Clarke, of the doctor’s disturbing comments, of the whispers from the colonists that seemed to follow her around wherever she went. She pulled up her knees and rested her head on them, her hands gripping her shins. *So tired. And it’s so hard to think.*

“What are your emotions?” Aria queried.

Kaylah stopped rocking.

“My emotions? Why? Why are you so interested in how I feel?”

“I have identified the better understanding of human emotions as a way to improve my capabilities.”

“So… you want to be a therapist? And I’m your guinea pig?” Kaylah’s raised voice echoed off the walls, and she cringed. She cast a nervous glance back down the silent side corridor.

“Guinea pig?”

“Never mind!” Kaylah snapped.

“Guinea pig. Metaphor. In a way, yes. You would be the first person I would help.”

“I don’t need help!” flared Kaylah.

They were both quiet for a moment. The ventilation fans turned on in the corridor, making soft sushing sounds.

Kaylah sighed. “I’m sorry, Aria, for yelling at you. It’s just that…”

“Apology accepted.”

“I don’t feel like myself. My mind is all… jumbled.”

“My data indicates teenagers are often emotional.”

“I guess.”

“Would you share your emotions?”

Kaylah shrugged. “Miserable, I guess. Sad.”

“Frustrated? Lonely?”

“Yeah, those too.” Kaylah stretched, extended her legs out in front of her, then stomped them a few times against the metal grating beneath her feet, feeling the metal vibrate. Her breath was puffs of vapor in the cold air.

“What does it matter? Can’t do anything about anything. Not the nightmares. Not about farming. Or even this frijing nav data.” She slumped, dejected. *Why do they hate me so much?*

From far off Kaylah heard faint voices, probably from the main corridor.

“Document!” Aria sang out.

“What?”

“The references I have suggest trying to document the dream, perhaps in a journal.“

“I’ve never journaled,” Kaylah mused. “Just sketched. A little.”

“Perhaps drawing would help?”

“Yeah, if we had much in the way of art supplies this far into the trip,” said Kaylah grumpily. *Would it have killed them to bring enough supplies for the entire trip? A budget ship.*

Silence filled the alcove. Liquid gurgled through a pipe overhead, accompanied by a clanking noise.

Kaylah started rocking again, her chin resting on her knees. A waft of clean air, with a hint of hot metal, flowed around her. She snuggled deeper into her old parka.

After a few moments the ancient workstation monitor flickered to life. A blinking cursor waited – Aria’s attempt at encouragement.

*Just writing is boring. It was more fun modeling my star data. Huh. Modeling.* She squinted her eyes, forcing her sluggish mind to think. Silence again filled the alcove.

Then, her eyes widened in realization.

“Aria?” she questioned.

“Yes?”

“Could you… could you help me model my nightmare?”

##### Scene 6.2: Faulty Sensor

In the crew mess, rank body odor dominated the small space and mixed with the faint smell of coffee and oatmeal. This many months into the trip, the smell barely registered. Emmett pushed back a curl of hair flopping on his forehead.

Next to the narrow table, the engineer balanced on two legs of a bar stool. “We’ve ah intermittent variation in the drive.”

“Ah small one,” the engineer continued. “Normal diagnostics could not find ah dratted thing wrong. I’m suspectin’ ah-nother faulty sensor like last run.”

“Still have enough spare sensors?” the captain asked. Once again he was standing, like the first mate, with his back to a bulkhead. Ren, the cargomaster, was staring blankly into his mug.

Emmett switched his gaze to the engineer and took another sip from his morning allotment.

“Yes, sir. 10 left. And, yes, I’ve already replaced the suspect sensor.”

The captain switched his gaze. “Mr. Emmett?”

“Yes, sir?”

“The beta water stop?”

“We’re still on schedule, sir. And the latest release of survey data had no change in status for the stop.”

Captain Brio nodded, his usual stoic countenance in place. “Supplies?”

Ren continued to stare at his mug.

“Ren!”

“Huh?”

“Supplies?”

“Oh, er, well, nothing special to report. Some colonists tried to make off with some of the community supplies, to hoard, or something. Mrs. Holang-Lee and I worked it out…”

His stare returned to his mug.

The first mate spoke up. “Second phase of our shipboard drills this week.”

Several crew members groaned. The most basic of drills had started long before launch and had continued as the Brio made its lonely way. Once onboard, most of the colonists had found the reality of space travel daunting, and the drills had not gone well. Despite the practice, some colonists remained clumsy, even panicky, with anything but the most basic of shipboard drills.

“I am prepared.”

The doctor’s precise voice carried the same smug superciliousness with a hint of greed. “I have ensured the medical bay is fully stocked. I am ready for any additional sprains, bruises, or other injuries.”

The first mate spoke again. “It almost goes without saying at this point, but the passengers are becoming irritable and restless. Our psychological gauge is now at level 5.”

Emmett shifted nervously. He knew cabin fever was par for the course, but level 5 — there were just so many colonists. And the crew, so few.

“Some minor clashes,” continued the first mate. “I’m helping the A.D. leverage some of our planned, er, surprise diversions to hopefully settle things a bit. No big problems. Some of the kids aren’t kept busy enough. And a few persistent nightmares we’re keeping an eye on.”

The captain raised an eyebrow at the first mate, who nodded in response.

“That’s all. Carry on.” The captain strode out of the tiny mess.

##### Scene 6.3: Karate Clumsy

*Thud.*

Stunned, Kaylah, could only stare at the bright lights rigged to the top of the cargo hold. The ringing of her ears overwhelmed the echoing sounds around her — kitchen workers clanking dishes, a few colonists grumbling at the nearby cafeteria tables, the murmuring of a few bystanders. The usual stale odors of sweat and the unwashed swirled in the air.

She lay flat on her back on a training mat.

*What happened?* She sighed. *I’m ending up on the mat much more now than when we started! Is that how it goes when you go up a belt? It didn’t seem like it would be this hard! This form is so similar to those other three. Why can’t I get this?*

Snickering and whispered taunts reached her drifted over from the bystanders. *Great, Nikka and her friends are here. Of course they are. They haven’t been here for days, until I’m flat on the mat.*

“Let’s try that again,” said the instructor.

Kaylah levered herself up off the mat and resumed her stance.

“Horseback-riding stance, then…” *Will I have a horse on Perth? Probably be too busy mucking out stalls to even—*

“Kaylah, concentrate!”

By the end of the session, exhaustion and utter frustration swamped Kaylah. She plodded out of the cargo hold, her face averted from those she passed. *It didn’t used to be this hard. Why can’t I learn this sequence? The first two were so easy. I’m such a failure. I can’t stop my nightmares, I can’t get this sequence. No one cares—*

##### Scene 6.4: E Talks with Captain

With clanking sounds echoing oddly around him, Emmett shut the hatch. Behind him the captain, the sleeves of his utilities rolled up, attempted to crank a large spoked hand wheel. The piercing brightness of the nearby work light threw deep shadows into the recesses between pallets.

He took a deep breath. “Um, sir, may I talk with you?”

“Hold this.” The captain handed a large wrench to Emmett. “Whack it.”

“What?”

“Hit the spoke on this side. Hard.”

Emmett stared at the captain. “Um…”

Wiping the sweat off his forehead with a rag from his utility belt, the captain sighed. “It’s stuck. Just give it a whack.”

Emmett struck the crank, the resounding sound vibrating down through the metal grating under his feet.

“Again. Harder.”

This time, accompanying the vibrations, a dusting of metal flakes fell to the floor.

“Okay, that should do it.” With bulging forearms, the captain levered the crank all the way to the left.

“Now,” he said, taking the tool back from Emmett. “Work that back and forth for awhile.”

Emmett grasped the spoke to shift it to the right. Nothing happened.

“We’re going to have to up your strength training. Put some oomph into it!”

Planting his feet, Emmett shoved harder. He hadn’t expected life onboard ship to be so… physical, despite the extensive preparations by school and family.

With a groan, the crank finally moved. It squealed as it settled into the right-hand position.

“Back again.”

Straining with effort, Emmett worked the latch back, then forth. The squealing lessened. “Captain?”

“Yes?”

“I have some concerns about a patient-”

“Stop cranking.” The captain added oil to the valve seat. “Have you discussed this with the doctor?”

“Well, yes, but-”

“Work it out.”

“Sir—” Emmett broke off. He forced the lever again, with a frustrated wrench. It clanked into position with a clunk that echoed across the hold.

“Not so hard!” Captain Brio wiped his hands of oil and considered Emmett. “What bothers you?”

Emmett quickly outlined Kaylah’s medical history, and his growing concern about her health — increased clumsiness, her pallor. Even as he talked, even to himself, he sounded unconvincing.

“Lately, she’s been a great deal clumsier than usual, according to other—”

“Hold,” the captain said. He collected the tools with deliberate precision, neatly organizing them.

After a moment, the captain said, “I approve of your work onboard ship. You have done well. This is not a real issue.”

He tucked the tools away in a carry-all. “Teens are clumsy. Some clumsier over time. It’s part of growing up — if you remember, ” the captain said, pointedly.

A red flush climbed the pale skin of Emmett’s neck.

“Let the doctor do his thing. After medicating the girl, sleep rates in Berth C improved. I’m told.” The captain lifted an eyebrow. “Need I remind you the mental stability of the colonists are of primary concern?”

“No, sir.”

After they exited to the corridor and walked to the junction, the captain stopped, his stern visage dropping away for a moment. He squeezed Emmett’s shoulder affectionately. “Emmett, try not to worry. It is under control, and it will be okay.”

“Yes, Uh—” Emmett caught himself. “Yes, sir.”

“And don’t forget to up your dietary intake, especially protein, when you up your strengthening regimen.”

The captain strode off. Emmett stood for a moment watching him go, running a hand through his hair, adding to its unruliness.

##### <!-- TODO: 1 --> Scene 6.5: Social Fail

The ball flew by Kaylah’s head and slammed against the metal wall. She lurched back in surprise, losing her balance and falling against the wall herself.

*Ow!*

She pulled away and moved after the ball, but Nikka beat her to it. The older girl leaped toward her team’s goal, and the other players followed at her heels.

Kaylah huffed in frustration.

“Drink some water, Kaylah,” Jonah called, waving her over. He and Amy had just come off the floor, and Amy was already chugging her water.

“Yeah, yeah.” Kaylah plodded over to them by the pile of water bottles and bags thrown haphazardly by the exit. She shook her head sharply, trying to shake the sluggishness that gripped her.

The teenagers had appropriated a smaller storage area, one now-empty at this point of the trip. The lighting wasn’t great, and the reek of disinfectant had long been replaced with the smells of sweat and bad breath, but Kaylah savored the moment. She could pretend she belonged.

It was thanks to Jonah and Amy that Kaylah was even playing. *I don’t know how they convinced the others. I hope — I hope — they let me come back the next time.* The med metrics had prompted a medical prescription for her to get more exercise, and karate was embarrassingly hard these days. *I’m so tired. Karate, and this… But, at least, here I can hang out with the others. As long as they let me.*

Out on the floor several of the more popular girls vied for the venti ball. All of them played with intensity tinged with a little desperation.

“They’re getting better,” said Amy.

“Let’s go,” urged Jonah. He called, louder, to the others, “Coming in!”

A whistle blew, and the action stopped. Nikka, glaring at Kaylah, muttered something to friends nearby.

Kaylah smiled hopefully at her.

Nikka scowled harder.

“Ready?” Jonah asked. The whistle blew, and they ran in.

By ten minutes in, they were all breathing hard and adding to swelling scent of sweat in the air. The venti ball bounced off the walls at different angles, accompanied each time with a resounding thump. Players thrust, whacked, and spun the ball in frenetic glee.

Jonah dodged around another teenager and threw the venti ball like a missile at Kaylah. She barely caught it, then clutched it to her chest as she weaved and twisted around her opponents.

*Almost there!*

Her foot caught. She tried to keep her balance, she tried to catch herself, she tried to fall as she had many times before in Master Geary’s class, but she landed hard on her knee then fell to the floor, curled protectively around the ball.

She oofed as a foot kicked her ribs. Nikka reached down and jerked the venti out of Kaylah’s hands. A whistle was blowing furiously.

“Nikka! What the—” exclaimed Jonah.

“What? It was an accident. I stumbled.”

Amy knelt by Kaylah. “Don’t move, Kaylah.” She started a brisk examination.

*Wonder if she ever works with the crew medic? Oh yeah, vets aren’t supposted to—* “Ouch!”

Amy’s hands had found the kicked ribs.

“Should I call…?” Jonah asked Amy.

“Just bruising and a knee sprain, Kaylah,” Amy’s warm brown eyes reassured. “No, Jonah, just ice. Unless her parents decide differently. Let’s get her to them.”

*Oh no!*

“I can stand.” Her voice cracked. She struggled to her feet, swaying. “Oh, oh, oh.” She winced in pain.

Amy and Jonah moved as one, supporting Kaylah from each side.

What will Grandma and Dad say?

“I’ve seen you take a hundred falls in Master Geary’s class,” Jonah said. “What happened?”

“I… I don’t know,” said Kaylah miserably.

“Could the gas be affecting her?” Jonah asked Amy.

“That was weeks ago. It shouldn’t still be affecting her. And they’ve tested the tranquilizing gases left, right, and sideways.”

“I’m right here, guys.”

“Sorry, Kaylah.” Jonah steadied Kaylah against Amy for a moment so he could swing their duffels on to his back.

Snickers came from behind. Craning her neck, Kaylah could see Nikka and her friends laughing. Tears pooled in her eyes. “Can we get out of here?”

Amy glanced back at the teenagers, then her eyes met Jonah’s. They moved out into the side corridor, and the door shushed behind them.

Emmett strode toward them.

*Oh, no, not him, too.*

“Huh. How did he know?” Amy questioned Jonah.

He shrugged. “The AI, I guess.”

“Her name is Aria,” Kaylah whispered.

“Is she okay?” Emmett queried, looking from Amy to Jonah.

*I’m right here.*

“Just twisted her knee a bit,” Amy replied.

“What happened?” Emmett asked Amy.

A red flush of embarrassment worked its way up Kaylah’s face.

“She tripped in a venti game, and she fell, hard.”

“Let me see.”

They eased her to the floor, and she leaned back against the smooth metal wall of the corridor. She pressed one hot, flushed cheek against the coldness seeping in through the wall while the medic ran a scanner.

“Yep, ice.” Mr. Emmett concluded. “Although those ribs…” He glanced at Jonah, who glanced at Nikka, then back to Mr. Emmett.

“Do the ribs hurt? How are you overall, Kaylah?”

*I am so tired. My brain hurts.*

“I’m fine.”

His warm eyes held doubt. “If you start feeling nauseous, or that headache I think you have gets worse, you tell your family, okay? Have them bring you to the medbay.”

*Grandma is gonna be mad.*

“Okay, Kaylah?” prompted Mr. Emmett.

She nodded with a fake smile, clenching her back teeth against the pain blossoming. “Sure, Mr. Emmett.”

### Episode 4

#### Chapter 7: Bridge Sequence

##### Scene 7.1: Bridge Tour

Ignoring the dull ache that settled deep in her bones, Kaylah peered through the dimness, trying to see forward in the corridor packed with the taller teenagers. They had gathered in the small space just aft of the bridge. Talk buzzed among the students as one of the teachers, squeezed up against one wall, repeated her instructions.

She sighed, settling back flat on her feet, and rubbed her head. Her thoughts were like pillow stuffing or something.

After her injury during venti, her grandmother had forbid Kaylah from playing venti or even karate. Kaylah’s pleading over the next few weeks finally convinced her father to override the decision, and she had returned to her martial arts lessons last week.

*Like I can do karate anymore. I’m so clumsy. Such a loser!*

She stumbled again, but finally wormed her way to a wall. She leaned against the cold metal wall, pressing the side of her head against the coolness. One of the pipes next to her cheek made a warm contrast.

At eighteen months into the trip, most of the colonists were a little crazy. *A little crazy? Some are A LOT crazy.* Despite the colony’s management, and the ship’s crew, efforts with surprises and celebrations, word was that the psycho meter thing was rising.

*Surprises? Ha!* She shifted her feet. *I bet they planned them back on Earth.*

The teacher was ending her speech, so Kaylah left her spot next to the wall in the back and attempted to push her way forward, the smell of the unwashed bodies assaulting her nose. The group, packed in tighter toward the bridge doors, shifted, and she struggled to keep upright in the mass of the taller, looming teens.

“Freak!” hissed Nikka.

*Every chance she gets.* Kaylah sighed. *Why?*

The bridge door shushed open. 

*It’s automated. Nice.*

The teacher stepped through, and the others followed. Kaylah trailed after the group. She stepped inside.

Stars filled the bridge.

Her mouth fell open, and she pirouetted in slow motion. Viewscreens curved around forming a near half-oval, reaching up to a ceiling far overhead, and curving to almost below their feet. Bright light washed over the group. Stars flowed and mesmerized. She barely heard the captain introducing himself and the bridge crew, and she stared, wide-eyed, entranced. She absently tucked her hands into her parka pockets, smiling until her cheeks hurt.

Her tormentor, Nikka, for once ignored her. All of the teenagers were quiet. They huddled at the back of the bridge near one the teachers — Mrs. Pender — and the captain. They, too, stared around at immensity of stars.

Kaylah edged to one side, soaking up details. Up front on the consoles the first mate and navigator worked, their features shadowed by the brilliance of stars flowing by. She squinted at the smaller displays over the consoles as cold air gently wafted against her hair. The cold here was different somehow, clearer, cleaner, crisper.

The navigator. She blinked against the bright light of the stars. Oh, yeah, Mr. Emmett. She blinked dry, aching eyes, and slowly turned in a full circle again, her eyes sweeping over everything.

The captain concluded his speech, and hands raised for questions.

As captain answered questions, Kaylah noticed his gravelly voice of the captain was underlaid with a slight accent.

*Is he Scottish?*

“When we will get there?”

“As of now, we arrive in orbit at Perth in seventeen months, three days, and five hours.”

One of the boys exclaimed, “What? Wait, that’s later than the schedule we had at launch!”

Kaylah rolled her eyes, even as she continued to examine the room. *Like the arrival time isn’t shown constantly on the screens in the mess, and in hydroponics, and outside the passenger berths—*

“Delays are inevitable, as are minor course corrections. We will arrive safe and sound.”

*Yeah, as long as the water holds out. And we don’t get hit with a hunk of space rock. And this cheap ride doesn’t break.*

*Wait, that’s not fair.* She sighed, watching the navigator with envy as his hands moved in a dance over his console.

*Brio’s Hope is a good ship. I like her. And Aria. And the crew seems nice.* She forced her thoughts away from the doctor.

“Where are we?” asked one of the girls.

The captain gestured. “Mr. Emmett, if you would?”

*Duh — he’s the navigator AND the medic. I should pay attention better. I should have remembered that. Stupid! It’s like I’m getting dumber all the time.*

“Are we going to make it?” asked another boy.

*What kind of question is that?*

“We are doing everything in our power to make this trip comfortable and safe for everyone. The Brio has been in operation since…”

*Didn’t talk about how likely it is we’ll end up at the planet safe and sound. Hah!* Kaylah knew the odds; anyone paying the least bit of attention knew it was dangerous. The odds were something she recalculated every week.Well, she used to. Now she just asked Aria. It was easier than trying to make her mind do the math.

“Next question.”

Kaylah, who had quietly continued to check out the room, blurted out, “Is that a Acme 10 or a Moonstar 112 console?”

Faces turned to stare at her. She blushed.

“Nerd!” She heard someone whisper.

She ducked her head to watch the light play on the textured metal floor, struggling to ignore yet another taunt.

The captain replied gently, “A Moonstar 112 from Xerxes.”

Kaylah nodded in response. She shot a tiny smile at the captain before ducking her head again.

“Any more questions?”

After a pause, a boy from the back called, “Where’s the bathroom?”

The captain chuckled politely before turning aside to answer a teacher’s question. *He looks tired.*

While the crowd broke into smaller groups, some talking with the captain and the teachers, Kaylah edged closer to the console where the navigator worked.

Emmett glanced over at the little girl, enquiringly.

“Do you…” she stopped and bit her lip.

With an indulgent smile, Emmett gestured for her to continue.

“Do you use Sanborn’s open source, or Terra C’s?” she asked.

“Both, mainly Terra C’s,” he answered, surprised. “You know open-source bases?”

“How do you model the data? Visually?” she asked.

“Here, want to see?”

Nodding her head vigorously, she avidly watched the spot over his flying fingers for the holographic projecting. Instead, the star charts appeared in front of the now mostly dark viewscreen, filling a large crescent at the front of the bridge.

“Ooooh…” she whispered. The tiny pinpricks of light around them were sorting themselves into patterns she recognized.

“That’s Rigel, right?” She pointed.

“Yes. You know your stars?”

“Way over there, that’s— Altares.”

She jabbed her finger at another spot in the projection. “And that’s where we started.” Another jab. “And that’s where we left the main interstellar route.” More jabs. “And that’s where we had that awful drill, and that’s where the debris pinged on the hull, that’s where the radiation blasted us for—”

Emmett interrupted. “See, this is where we are now. These are the markers for our course—”

They both had drifted, moving into the holographic field.

“And the blue ones are for the water stops, right?”

“Yes, the primary ones—”

“And the yellow are the alternates, and way over here is the station, and these greyed out ones are the ones we’ve—”

Emmett laughed. “Yes, that’s right.” He smiled indulgently.

“So, can you bring out the major stars used for the navigation? In a Camden set?”

“Of course. We can filter the sets any number of—”

“No, I mean, can you show me?” she asked.

He flicked at control and bent his head near her curl-topped one, both sets of hands gesturing at the various star systems, the projection changing fluently with each controlling movement. Emmett was steadily becoming more and more impressed.

“And the open-source data set? You have the Ridlan release?”

“Yes.”

“If the nav sets had—”

“Mr. Emmett!”

*Ow!* Kaylah winced. *That was loud.* The brightness of the holographic projection vanished. She blinked in the dimness.

Mr. Emmett had swung away to face the captain. “Yes, sir?”

“Time for our young students to leave.” The captain gestured toward the door.

The group of teenagers were leaving, some pushing against each other as they exited through the bridge doors. One of the teachers gestured impatiently to Kaylah.

*Bummer!*

“Oh, I’ve got to go. Thank you, thank you, thank you!” She scurried over the door, throwing longing looks back at the display and continuing streaming polite thank-you’s at the crew. And promptly crashed into the straggling students at the back of the group.

“Clumsy, aren’t we?” drawled a boy with red-rimmed eyes.

“Noisy little screamer,” said another.

She recognized him from the passenger cabin and hung her head. Her recent moans during the sleep shift weren’t that loud, not like her previous screams. *It’s just a stress thing. The meds are helping. The meds are helping. The meds are helping.*

##### Scene 7.2: Dream is Real

Back in the alcove days later, above the workstation, a holographic field was peppered with the sparks of stars and accented with the swirls of gasses. Kaylah’s hands waved in graceful swoops inside the field, the data visualizations dancing in coordination with the opera in the background. The small alcove felt warm and inviting as she hummed along with the melodic line.

“Aria, what’s our progress?”

“Analysis and cataloging are 60% complete.”

“Wow, really? And we were at 20% when we started. I couldn’t have done it without you! You rock, Aria! I’m so glad we met…” She stopped. Putting her hands on her hips, she examined a problem in data.

Aria said, “Today you seem… better? More alert?”

“Well, it does seem we’re making progress now,” Kaylah replied.

“No,” Aria paused. “I mean, you seem brighter. More energetic.”

“I do feel better. Not as groggy.”

“What about your nightmare?”

“Oh, well—” Kaylah bit her lip before rushing on “—you were right. Modeling the nightmare’s star system really helped. Great therapy. You’re on the right track with that. Do you help the doctor onboard when you’re not—”

“Are you still having the nightmares?”

Kaylah’s shoulders slumped. She turned to stare blankly down the dimness of the side corridor.

*Does she know something?* *I didn’t mean to yell so loud in the middle of the night last night. Or the night before. They’re getting worse again.* *Did the other passengers actually sign that petition they talked about? I’m scared. I don’t want to be locked up.* *And Dad and Grandma, the panicked look in Dad’s eyes… Even Grandma is worried. I can tell.*

She spun back around to glare at the decrepit table and chair. “I don’t want to talk about it, okay? Let’s just—”

A soft tone interrupted, and the opera music faded.

“Um,” Kaylah said. “What is that for, Aria?”

“A search result.”

“For what?” Kaylah asked, puzzled.

“The star system. I searched for a match.”

“Which star system?” Kaylah asked impatiently. She waved a hand at the field. “A match to what? Were you running analysis to compare different star systems in that last nav data set?”

The opera in the background subsided to a slower section with a deep brass line carrying the music.

“No,” Aria responded. “The one we modeled.”

“The one we modeled? Which—“ Her face paled, and she collapsed into the alcove’s chair.

“The one— the one— from my nightmare?”

“Yes. A very unique system. It was in one of the tertiary sets—”

“But— but— but—” she sputtered. “Aria—”

The opera ended. The shush of ventilation fans, and a cold breeze eddied around her.

“Aria, my dreams are NOT REAL!!”

Aria made no reply. In the silence Kaylah’s mind jumped back and forth, between the vision of the wrecked derelict, the star charts, Aria’s help.

*Did Aria make an error? AI’s can’t do that, can they? But, it’s not possible. Not possible. Not possible!*

She cleared her throat. “Uh… How closely does it match?”

“In the latest versions of star navigation databases we possess, with two hundred thirteen million systems, fourteen binary systems are similar.”

Kaylah wrapped her arms around herself and nibbled her bottom lip.

“One binary system matches.”

She started rocking back and forth, the creaking of the chair adding an ominous counterpoint. It felt like an eternity before she could force herself to speak again. “So there’s a star system that matches. Big deal. It’s a big universe. Where is it?”

“In this quadrant, although not very close to our route.”

“Huh.”

The ventilation fans cut off. The rough vibrations underfoot subsided.

“How close of a match?”

“The match matches the known characteristics by 67.7%”

Kaylah tilted her head back, staring at the light overhead. Her parka hood fell back, and she shuddered. Even with the insulated coat sleeves, goosebumps pricked at her arms.

“I can’t possibly be having nightmares about a real place… Right?”

#### Chapter 8: Dangerous Journey

##### Scene 8.1: FTL Entry (Colonists)

*Ugh, I can’t breathe!*

The pressure was intense. The rumbling and roaring pounded on her ears as Brio’s Hope strained to exit FTL space. The pressure eased, then hit hard again as the ship bucked. The harness cut into her flesh. The wild gyrations settled into a gentler oscillation, and Kaylah took advantage, gulping air into her aching lungs.

*Aren’t we done yet?*

A strong series of jolts answered, increasing in tempo. Whimpers coming from down the jump cabin escalated into cries.

*Ha! It wasn’t—*

The world turned upside down. An increasing rumble joined the ship’s jolts. Her headache flared.

*Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.*

The ship pitched. The fall seemed to last forever.

*Wonder if this how that death ship went? Breaking apart in a bad FTL exit? Is it really real?*

Her stomach cramped in painful agony. The further into the trip, the more it bothered her. She struggled against the rising nausea.

*No, no, no, don’t... Don’t*.

She clenched her jaw. She was not going to throw up again.

The ship’s rumbles gentled to a steady beat as the ship’s movements eased into uneasy swells gentling into more shallow movement. She slowly breathed in, pulling more air into her aching lungs.

*Why all the nausea the last few months? I’ve never had a problem with space travel before!*

After an interminable wait, the emergency lights blinked from red to orange to green, then faded. When ordinary white light bathed the room, she blinked against the brightness, her eyes watering.

Sighs of relief wafted around the jump chamber.

“We— We made it.” A voice whispered from somewhere on Kaylah’s left.

“I can’t— I can’t go through that again!” A woman sobbed.

*If people had known how bad getting in and out of FTL was… But they did try to warn us. And how some day the tech will make it easier on people when crossing the threshold.* She snorted. *Bet those space liners have a gentler ride already.*

About her the colonists released buckles on harnesses. The one woman continued sobbing while her husband, with tender gentleness, disengaged the buckle on her jump seat and helped her to stand.

*Only about eight more FTL entries and exits to go. Only eight.*

She wobbled her way through the crowd of colonists exiting the jump cabin.

*Only eight — I hope.*

##### Scene 8.2: FTL Entry (Ship)

Meanwhile, on the bridge stars blinked into existence across the large viewscreen as Brio’s Hope wallowed into normal space.

“Status!” The captain’s voice rang out. He glared at the telemetry flowing by on the viewscreens, as if venomous snakes.

“We’re out. Analyzing data now…” Emmett’s fingers were already flying over his console. “That last jolt damaged the exterior array.”

“Position?” barked the captain.

“Accommodating for missing array!” sang out Aria.

Emmett’s eyes flicked across the telemetry and graphs moving across the screens. “We’re not close,” Emmett said. He added hurriedly, “I mean, we’re in system Delta-Tango-4010. It’s just that we landed in the outer system about—”

“Captain,” the engineer’s voice broke in. “The drive fluctuated, affecting the FTL exit—”

“Hold, Mr. Scully.” The captain fired off each word like bullets, his eyes snapping from one telemetry stream to another. “The intrasolar drive?”

The engineer answered, “The drive is working within nominal parameters, Captain.”

“Mr. Emmett?”

“Aria and I agree, sir. We’re about 90,000 clicks from the target.” He swallowed. “An estimated 15 days to arrival.”

Uneasy silence filled the bridge.

Finally, the captain settled in his command chair, leaned back, and stiffly let his arms fall on the chair rest. With a calmer voice, he said “Move us on, Mr. Emmett.”

“Aye, aye, Captain.” Emmett laid in the course, and Brio’s Hope started plodding its now-longer way toward the inner system where their destination lay just past an asteroid belt.

“Your were saying, Mr. Scully, about the drive…” The captain’s voice faded into the background.

Emmett’s mind raced as he focused on revising the remaining water stops, hoping against hope they would not have to adjust hydroponics or, even worse, ration comestibles.

He hoped.

## Part 3: Life and Threats in Space

### Episode 5: Water Stop

#### Chapter 9: Life in Space

##### Scene 9.3: Yum (Colonists)

Kaylah, in the rec hold, reverently crunched the last bit of her small cone, savoring creamy, sweet strawberry flavor. “Mmmmm…” While Brio’s Hope crawled toward the inner system inner system of DT-4010 and the water stop, colonists were having a party to celebrate the FTL exit.

*If the A.D. keeps calling for festivals for each and every FTL exit we’ve got left… we’re going to run out of this stuff. Or the portion size will drop to minuscule. Minuscule. That’s a fun word.* She giggled to herself. *Adjective. Extremely small; tiny.*

Her grandmother and father sitting at the table with her were, astonishingly, joking with each other. She smiled. The last time her grandmother laughed — she couldn’t even remember.

Around them crowds of colonists were also laughing and talking, despite the bruises and minor injuries from the rough exit. Music lifted above the crowd noise, and she twisted around to spot the band through the crowd.

A colonist with a goofy grin strode by with his eyes fixed on a sliver of carrot cake on the plate he carried. The smell of the cake teased her nose.

*Mmmm… yum!* She jumped out of her chair.

“Where are you going, Kaylah?” Her grandmother fixed her gaze on Kaylah, one eyebrow raised.

“Cake.”

“After that ice cream?” her grandmother questioned, then relented. “Not too much, though. Come right back.”

Kaylah nodded, already slipping away through the crowd. *Maybe the server will give me a larger piece again. She likes children. Not that I’m a child, but if gets me cake…*

She made it safely back through the throngs with the cake. Her dad had dealt out three hands of cards.

“Spades?” Kaylah mumbled, her mouth full of cake.

“Pick up your hand,” her dad said. “What are you waiting for? Christmas?”

She grinned.

As they played several hands of cards, the celebration around them increased.

“Wahooooo!” One of the colonists behind her yelled loudly. Two others, each with a beer in hand, leaned against each other and started singing, loudly and off-key. And not to the song the band was playing. She winced.

“Play already!” her father demanded.

She played a card then scanned the crowd.

More and more of the men had gathered in a circle, cheering and singing along.

“Kaylah, pay attention.”

Someone sprayed paper confetti over their table.

“Really?” Her grandmother sighed.

“Ooops-a, sorry,” slurred one of the specialists.

*Now the sounds of celebration were sounding a bit… desperate?*

Her eyes darted to her cards, to the table, here and there around the cargo hold.

“You lot! Take it elsewhere.” The diminutive assistant director shooed the noisiest group of men toward the hatch, even pushing a couple of the larger men toward the door. The men shambled out.

*Wow. How is she brave enough to do that?*

In another few hands, her grandmother was done playing cards. The clamor of the celebration had increased even more. It made Kaylah want to put her hands over her ears.

“Almost time for me to head to hydroponics,” her grandmother said.

“Could I see if anyone is playing venti?”

Her grandmother’s wrinkle of concern appeared. “No—”

At the same time, her father smiled. “Sure—”

She switched her gaze hopefully between each parent.

“Go ahead,” her dad said.

She escaped, leaving her parents arguing in low whispers as she slipped quickly through the crowd.

As she hurried down the side corridor, a group of men, maybe the same group, beers in hand, filled a side alcove and spilled out into the corridor, singing a drinking song.

*Not desperate. Hysteria. Yes, hysteria. That’s a better word. Noun. Exaggerated or uncontrollable emotion or excitement, especially among a…*

She zoomed through the group, trying to make it to the main corridor.

“Hey, hey, little girl,” one of the architects called after her.

She cast a nervous look back and sped up. *I’m not a little girl!*

He called louder, after her, “You know the star, uh, thingy. How soon will we get there?”

She stopped and pivoted to point behind him. *And I thought architects had a vocabulary? Thingy?* She snorted in disgust. She motioned for him to turn around.

He slewed around to see a screen displayed the water stop time and Perth arrival time.

“Oh.” He waved over his shoulder at Kaylah. “Thanks.”

His companions looked blankly at the wall. One of the civil engineers poked another in the chest. “I tell you, Frank, we’re doomed! Doomed!”

“Nah!” The second man weaved slightly.

“Doomed!” The first civil repeated, shoving at the other man’s shoulder.

“Hey, don’t push me!”

“Come, come on back, little girl!” The architect slurred his words.

A smacking thud had her glancing back. Now the men were punching and grappling with each other, with more and more piling on. Her eyes widened. Warning chimes pealed, and a martial melody layered over the chiming. The sound thundered, filling the hallway. Aria’s voice trumpeted over warning chimes, “Disperse! Disperse! Disperse!”

She sprinted for the main corridor, choking on the haze filling the cabin, diving through the hatch just as it slammed shut behind her, cutting off her glimpse of a gas settling over the crowd.

##### Scene 9.4: Water Stop

The journey to the water stop in the inner system had taken the predicted 15 days. Now, collector bots poured out from the ship’s starboard side in a steady stream and rapidly descended toward the surface gleaming white with ice. On the bridge’s main viewscreen the bots quickly dwindled in size until they appeared like nothing else but a mass of black spiders.

“Nearing landing sites—” Emmett’s hands hovered over the console. He focused on the feeds streaming by, aware of the captain’s quiet presence behind him. It was somehow comforting.

The view screen had now split to show telemetry side-by-side with visual feeds from descending bots.

“Nearing the surface,” Emmett called.

The ventilation fans hummed in the background. A waft of cool air ruffled a curl of Emmett’s hair. It flopped on his forehead.

“Wait— collector \#12 over-fired its thrusters—”

Mr. Davis leaned in closer, peering over Emmett’s shoulder.

“The software corrected it,” Emmett added.

Mr. Davis exhaled softly and leaned back slightly. His garlic-scented breath wafted under Emmett’s nose, but Emmett hardly noticed.

As each collector reached the ice field, it hovered, then fired canisters from all eight legs into the ice.

“Canisters away.”

The fired canisters shot into the ice. By now, the collector bots drones were rotating a full circle and back, lasers in each leg stabbing deep and carving out ice.

“Three hours. Estimated.” Emmett straightened, his shoulders no longer hunched over the console, but his eyes still flitted over the sensor displays with focused intensity. “Until the first returns.”

The first mate stood up and stretched, then leaned to once again peer over Emmett’s shoulder.

“Davis?” The captain called from behind them.

“Yes, Captain?” the first mate replied. His gaze flicked between Emmett’s console and the display above.

“Go help the assistant director reassure passengers. We have this operation in hand for now.”

Davis pulled his attention away from Emmett’s work to look over his shoulder at the captain. He gave the captain a wry grin. “Right-o. On my way, sir.”

After the door shushed behind the first mate, the bridge was silent. The captain advanced until he was bathed in the glow from the view screens. As the captain surveyed the green sensor readings, Emmett saw the clasped hands behind the captain’s back ease their tight grip.

“Good job,” the captain’s voice rumbled.

“Thank you, sir.”

“You have—” the captain coughed to clear his throat “—done very well—”

Emmett started to smile.

“—for a new crew member.”

His smile slipped away. He nodded at the captain in response.

Silence filled the bridge as telemetry continued to move up the view screens. Emmett flicked his eyes to the scrolling data every few seconds as the hologram in front of him changed and rotated. Time passed.

Musical beeping began. Red-flagged telemetry appeared. Emmett’s hands started a dance over the console.

“Drone failure.”

Video firmed and sharpened. Pieces of the water collector were scattered, black shards and chunks of ice strewn across the dirty white landscape.

“A crash?” asked the captain.

“Yes,” Aria and Emmett replied in unison, her musical voice overlaying his deeper one.

“Doesn’t look retrievable,” the captain said.

Emmett wondered if the captain was joking.

“Aria, adjust for the missing bot.”

“Yes, captain.” Her voice swooped and down melodically. “It will delay departure by approximately 3 hours.”

“Emmett, after you adjust our planned course and schedule, double-check your calculations on the course and water supply with Aria’s.”

“Yes, captain. Of course.”

“Let me know the impact on available water.”

“Yes, sir.” Emmett remained intent on the data streams.

“Another Acmetel drone, wasn’t it?” asked the captain.

“About 60 percent of our drones are,” Emmett said as he flicked a finger and darted a look at the small data window that appeared, replacing the telemetry overlaying the image of the crashed drone. “Yes, Acmetel,” he confirmed, and flicked the window closed, his attention once more solely on the water collection.

“Collection completes in 8 hours, 53 minutes,” lilted Aria.

The captain cleared his throat again. “I’ll be in my ready room. You have the bridge.”

“I have the bridge.”

##### Scene 9.5: Second Nightmare

*From behind the planet a ship appeared. A dart of silver in moonlight, it curved around a blue moon into the dark and dived toward her, the bow aiming like a knife descending in darkness. The nacelles gleamed with menace. It streaked toward her. It was coming. It was evil.*

“No!! No!! No!!”

Her screams woke her. She lurched upright, only to crack her head on the bottom of her grandmother’s bunk. Pain erupted.

“Ow, ow, ow,” she whispered.

Around her voices mumbled and swore.

“What the he—”

“I just want some sleep!

“Shut the !#$% up!”

“It’s that kid again.”

Silently she shrunk down in her bed. Her head hurt.

*Oh, no, no, not again.*

Her dad flung himself down from his bunk to the floor, blocking her from the irate passengers shambling over to their triple-stack of bunks.

“That’s it!” a man snarled.

Her eyes darted to one side, then another, in the dimness of the cabin. Silent tears streaked down her cheeks.

“No more, Broussard! We’ve had it.”

Her dad made calming gestures with his hands. “She hasn’t had a nightmare in months. An aberration. That’s all,” he said.

The other passengers were not placated. She wiped at the tears and felt a trickle of something viscous on her fingers.

“She goes, or you go.” Mr. Clarke stomped off. The others slowly followed, a few casting menacing glares back at Kaylah.

One woman — Mrs. Littleton, one of the cooks — lingered. She whispered, “Mr. Broussard, I feel for you, I really do. But something needs to be done. The others, well, it’s been a long two years. I don’t think she’s—” the woman nodded at Kaylah, “—safe.”

*Not quite 2 years.*

The woman scurried off, and the cabin quieted.

Her dad thumped down on her mattress, barely avoiding hitting his own head.

In the dimness Kaylah stared at the drops of blood on her fingers.

“Dad?” she questioned tentatively.

Not responding, he continuing to stare at nothing. His slumped shoulders made him look somehow smaller.

“Dad?” she asked again. Panic rose again in another wave, overriding the ache from the bump on her head.

He sighed, his shoulders slumped. “I don’t know what to do,” he whispered.

Her heart squeezed.

*But Dad always has an answer.*

They sat there in the darkness. The ventilation fans whirred, covering the sounds of those settling back to sleep around them.

#### Chapter 10: Threats to Kaylah

##### Scene 10.1: Petition Threatens Kaylah

“Broussard.”

Her father jerked his head up. “Huh?” His red, sleep-rimed eyes were underlaid with dark circles. He had been stirring his coffee for a long time. With her knit cap pulled over the bandage on her forehead, Kaylah huddled in the chair next to him, trying to force down the oat gruel.

“They’re passing a petition about…” The band’s guitarist shot Kaylah a concerned glance. “…about your daughter.”

“What!?!”

The guitarist— *one of the geologists?* —gestured to a nearby table. An old-fashioned clipboard traveled from hand to hand. Heads were nodding. One man was wagging a finger at another, his voice rising, “—decent night’s sleep! Get that freak out—”

Her father’s face reddened.

“They’re wanting to follow through on forcing her to go to the medbay. They want the doctor to sedate her on the night cycle…” the guitarist trailed off.

“Thanks, Mike,” her father replied. “I appreciate it.”

Her father did not look at her. Kaylah sat frozen, feeling like a rabbit surrounded by wolves. *Is Dad mad at me?*

“How—” Her dad paused. “How many signatures?”

“700 and climbing.”

##### Scene 10.2: Crew Briefing

The weeks after the water stop passed in a blur of activity. Ship maintenance and cleaning. Inventory. Interfacing with the colonists.

The crew met again for a briefing. The captain and Mr. Davis perched in their usual locations. Emmett sat at the table with his professional, stoic face on. Even now, the captain’s reaming still rankled.

“Exterior threats?” the captain said, as soon as the hatch shushed behind the doctor.

“Hull monitors and inspection bots have found no recent significant damage,” Emmett answered crisply.

“Interior threats?” the captain queried Mr. Davis, with one eyebrow raised.

“After the gassing on the last water celebration day, things have mostly been quiet,” Mr. Davis replied. “The A—”

“I had to sedate two hysterical women,” the doctor interrupted.

“Let Mr. Davis finish,” said the captain. He leaned back in his chair, waving the first mate to go on.

“The A.D. reports concern about the mental state of the passengers as a body, although the water break helped. They’re rolling out another of their surprises soon, but the longer we take to get there?” He shrugged.

The crew knew that the longer the transit took, the more likely mental health problems would develop into dangers. The studies were extensive, not to mention their own personal experiences.

“Aria?”

“Yes, captain?”

“Your monitoring?”

“Captain, as you know, while I am studying assiduously, human psychology is not my field of expertise.”

“No need to qualify, Aria. Are you tracking anyone?”

“I am tracking thirty-one individuals exhibiting behaviors of concern, but none seemed to have progressed to a point where intervention would be constructive.”

“Thank you, Aria.”

“We need to medicate those around us in that state before anyone has a psychotic break. I have several drugs—”

“Not necessary, doctor. Not at this point. Are we clear?”

“Captain?” Mr. Davis asked softly.

“Yes?”

“There’s that petition.”

Captain Brio narrowed his eyes. “Ridiculous!”

Emmett’s jaw clenched.

“Passengers are clamoring. They went through eight months of ‘sleepless hell’, as one of them put it, last time.”

“It is unfortunate that the drug given her has lost its efficacy.” The doctor did not sound disappointed but rather avaricious. “Perhaps it’s time for more drastic measures.”

Decisive instructions poured out from the captain. “Wait two weeks. If the situation does not change, confine her to medbay for the night cycle. Sleep meds only, and only during nighttime.” He fixed a steely glare at the doctor. “Are we clear? Good.”

Mr. Davis spoke. “We also need to consider her safety, sir, from the other passengers, with the growing instability among the colonists.”

“Aria? Will you monitor, protect, and alert on Kaylah Broussard?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Engineering?”

Scully shifted forward, the front two legs of the stool hitting the metal floor with a dull clang.

“Acmetel has hit us where it hurts with these faulty parts,” he drawled grimly. “Spares are runnin’ low.”

“Any trouble making it to Heinlein Station? They’ll have some stock, right?”

The engineer growled, “I’m no crystal ball!” He huffed, crossing one bulky arm over another. “My estimates mean very little in these circumstances — when we’re dealing with an unknown failure rate on parts, whether another piece of debris will come crashing across the hull, or whether we take more damage the next time we exit FTL, or whether that drive flutter means anything. All this wear and tear of the longer transit—”

Mr. Davis shook his head and sighed.

“—and whatever the crazy colonists do to the ship. Last party Aria caught one of ‘em tryin’ to pee in a drone closet—”

The cargo master started laughing. After a beat, Mr. Davis joined in, then the rest of the crew, even the doctor with a guffaw like a donkey. Even the captain cracked a grin.

“Did she…”

“Yep.”

To another round of laughter, the engineer relaxed in his chair, stretching his hairy arms over his head in a stretched. He yawned.

“Scully?”

“Yes, sir?”

“Get some sleep. Everyone, dismissed.”


##### Scene 10.3: Unjustified Criticism for E

As Emmett eased the weights back into their frame, he heard the shush of the hatch and sat up, turning to see the captain striding in. The workout clothes, so incongruous with the formality the captain exuded, always struck Emmett as humorous. He hid a grin behind his towel as he wiped away sweat.

“Hello, captain,” he said, buoyantly.

“Emmett.” The captain nodded.

Emmett began wiping down the weight bench while the captain placed his gear on a hook next to the folded mats stored on the wall.

The captain hesitated for a second. “Emmett?”

“Yes, sir?”

“Let’s talk.”

Emmett stopped his efforts, and slowly turned to face the captain. “Okay…”

“I know your grandmother and aunt, they must have talked to you about—” The captain stopped.

“Sir?”

Unlike his usual speech, the captain’s words came out in rush. “You’ve brought up concerns about that girl.”

“Kaylah? Yeah.”

The captain’s brows furrowed, with one brow tilted higher. “And you talked with her an excessively long time on the bridge.”

Emmett wrinkled his forehead, his brows mirroring the captain’s.

“And you helped her after the ship’s drill.”

“That was awhile ago, sir. Just doing my job.” Emmett was puzzled.

“You seem to have an inordinate interest in this girl.”

“Sir?!”

The captain plowed on. “Emmett, we do not fraternize with passengers. Especially young women.”

“Young woman?” Emmett burst out, astonished. “She’s a little—”

“Emmett!” The captain’s voiced cracked like a whip.

Emmett subsided.

“Spending time with Kaylah Broussard is not a good idea. Have I made myself clear?”

“Yes, sir!”

“Good. Dismissed.” With a quick nod, the captain strode over to the treadmill.

Emmett fumed his way out of the gym, back through the corridors, and into his quarters. As the hatch shut behind him, he threw his gear unto his bunk with unusual force.

“Fraternization?” he said loudly. He paced the three steps across his quarters and back.

“With a little girl?” He was angry. “What kind of man does my—” He hit one fist against another. “—he—my captain think I am? That’s disgusting!”

For the first time, he regretted signing on. “Maybe I should have taken that intrasolar offer.” He continued his pacing. “No, that wouldn’t have worked. Boring. But—”

Soft tones interrupted his stewing. “Briefing in 30 minutes,” announced Aria.

He sighed. “Thanks, Aria. Back work it is.”

### Episode 6: Personal Turning Point

#### Chapter 11: Kaylah Downed

##### Scene 11.1: Snubbed by Emmett

“Yes! Yes! Yes!” Kaylah jumped up. A few sharp jump kicks took her out of the alcove and down the alley. “Forty-eight percent faster! Oh, yeah!”

With Aria’s help, she had finished the algorithm that not only parsed more detail from the open source nav database, but also did it in about half the time.

“Saving lives! Yes! I am the hero!!” She attacked thin air with a knife hand attack. “Take that, perils of the universe!” She twirled a little pirouette. “Aria?”

No response.

“Aria?”

She sighed a little in response to the silence that followed. “I know you’re recording, so I just wanted to say thanks. I couldn’t have done it before planetfall without you. It was fun working with you. Oh, and the computations on the main nav set should be done in about two weeks.”

Her voice slowed. “It’s going to help, Aria. It’s going to save lives.”

She smiled. “I’m going to go tell Dad. Talk to you later!”

Zooming down the main corridor, she spotted Mr. Emmett.

He’s the nav guy, so he’ll get it. It was so much fun talking to him on the bridge last time about this stuff. He’ll know how important this is.

“Mr. Emmett! Mr. Emmett!”

Boy, he’s walking fast.

She ran after him. “Hey, Mr. Emmett!”

Breathing hard, she reached his side. He turned slowly to face her. “Guess what? I just finished. It took so long, but I finally did. It’s going to help. You’ll—”

“Ms. Broussard!” Emmett said sternly. “Running in the corridors is not safe.”

*Ms. Broussard?*

She faltered. “Oh, okay. But—”

“If you’ll excuse me, I have work to do,” he said coldly.

*Is he mad at me? Why? What did I do wrong? Does he think I’m a loser, too?*

She watched his departing back, feeling hollow. She wrapped her arms tight across her torso.

*I thought he would understand.*

##### Scene: 11.2: Sanctuary Vandalized

The coldness of the floor grate seeped into her. Huddled on the floor, hugging her knees, Kaylah rocked back and forth. Silent tears streamed down her face. She sat alone in the darkness.

The vandals had been thorough. The light in its wire cage had been shattered. Little pieces of keyboard trailed in sad clumps off the workstation surface and onto the floor. The chair, the squeaky chair, had met its end in someone’s forceful hands. Toilet paper festooned the workstation in sad mockery. The smell of urine swirled in the air, and from the surface pee dripped to the floor where pale golden puddles not yet dried completely.

She felt numb.

#### Chapter 12: Crisis

##### Scene: 12.1: Her Agency - She Chooses Meds

Kaylah suspiciously scanned the corridor in both directions, listening hard. No sounds. No people. She whipped the cabinet door open and squeezed into the compartment. Good. She had timed it when the cleaning bots were out. As she closed the door behind her, she rocked slightly on a damaged bot below her feet. It blinked a faint red of distress in the darkness.

I think it was broken before I got here. I think.

It was quiet. It was dark. It was safe.

Although it had taken her several days to find this hideaway, it was worth it. Sometimes she just needed to be alone, somewhere with a door that closed, a small space where it was just her.

She sat down and leaned back, the coldness of the wall seeping into the back of her head. She sighed in relief. Away from people angry with her, from people who didn’t like her, from people who didn’t care.

She blinked moisture away, then squeezed her eyelids together for a moment.

Okay, let’s think. Her fingers tapped the edge of the bot beneath her.

Okay, so, I have nightmares. I scream from the nightmares. Others are losing sleep. Long trips like this one can make people… Ugh, what’s a better word than psycho? She frowned.

Losing sleep makes the effects of the trip worse.

The medication is not working anymore.

I’m a failure at controlling my screaming with the nightmares.

The doctor and most of the passengers want to stick me in medbay on stronger meds during the night.

The stronger meds may be dangerous to me.

I can’t stop the nightmares, but I can choose to do something about it.

“My only option is the sedation.” Her voice sounded small and tinny in the compartment. “Grandma and Dad are going to have a cow.”

She stood and pulled up her parka’s hood. “No time like the present.”

She exited, turning to carefully latching the cabinet door behind her.

This is the right choice.

Head high, she strode off, heading for the medbay, confident and at peace for the first time in a long time.

##### Scene: 12.2: Doctor Forcibly Medicates

She saw the doctor heading her way. He came down the main corridor accompanied by two of the colonists, men from the construction contingent.

Determinedly, she continued toward them.

As she neared, she began, “Doctor, I—”

“Grab her!” yelled the doctor. His eyes gleamed with excitement.

“Aaaaaaaaa—” Kaylah yelled in surprise. A large hand cut her off.

“Hold her still.”

Kaylah struggled against the men holding her. She bit a hand.

“Ow, you—” the man bit off a curse.

“Let me go!” she yelled.

“It’s past time we remove this nuisance,” growled the man shaking his bitten hand.

A syringe came near her arm. Her eyes widened.

“What? No! Doctor, this isn’t necessary!”

The needle plunged into her arm, and her world went black.

##### Scene 12.3: E Stands Up / Stutter

The hatch crashed against the wall as Emmett rushed into the small gym.

“How could you let this happen?”

His cry bounced off the metal walls, interrupting a sparring session between captain and first mate. The two exchanged a look, and the captain stripped off his hand pads.

“Have a seat.” The captain gestured at the floor. He calmly wiped sweat from his face before he lowered himself to the floor next to the mat.

Ignoring the invitation, Emmett paced back and forth in the small space like a tiger in a cage. “Did you know the doctor was going to do this? Abduct a child, for Sol’s sake?”

“Action was needed. Ms. Broussard’s condition exacerbated colonists’ issues. And, she has become a scapegoat.”

“I’ve reviewed— that’s not the point.” He stopped to stare at the captain, trying to reach the man he thought he knew.

“Is this… is this who we are? As crew? As the Brio family?” He stared at his uncle, the captain, silently willing him to understand. “You know I’ve wanted to be in space, to be here, all my life. But this isn’t right! The doctor is a creep. What he did to Kaylah Broussard against her will? Just plain wrong.” He added, shouting now, “If this is what it means to be a Brio, I don’t want any part of it!”

A spark of— something? — flashed in his uncle’s eyes, and his usual stoic expression disappeared. He frowned as he pinched the bridge of his nose. “I—” —behind them Mr. Davis looked up at nodded at them— “—we— think the doctor is an unmitigated ass.”

Emmett stopped mid-stride. His jaw dropped.

His uncle continued, “An immoral sadist, and a possible pervert, and a bad bargain, and a lemon. We’re dumping his sorry self at Heinlein Station.”

“Wha—”

“We didn’t want the doctor to know we’re breaking contract until the station. We need his skills until then, for the passengers, and to train you.” His uncle rose to his feet. “It’s terrible what he did to Ms. Broussard. We owe her, the poor traumatized kid. This journey is bad enough, but…” His uncle looked Emmett in the eye. “I promise you, we will get her the best help we can.”

Emmett nodded reluctantly.

“But she is going to remain sedated at night in the medbay.”

“It’s just, just— Well, did Aria tell you?”

“Tell me what?”

“Kaylah was on her way to medbay to request the sedation when that— that— son of a dung heap accosted her. She tried to tell them, but the doctor had the syringe stuck in her before even Aria realized what was going on.”

His uncle swore in a stream of profanity that Emmett had never heard from him.

Thudding sounds began accompanying the profanity; Mr. Davis was attacking the training dummy in a powerful series of kicks. He stopped, to growl at them, “I would throw that son-of-a-bitch out the airlock if he was worth that much of my time.”

“Me, too, Mike, me, too.” His uncle’s face looked worn and haggard. “Keep an eye on the doc, Emmett, if you would. Aria’s been monitoring him, but the abduction— well, she didn’t know what they were doing until they did it.”

“I was planning on it, sir. Something about how he acts around the teenagers really bothers me.”

His uncle rubbed his temples. He started tapping a finger, as if in thought. He stood, his body stiffening briefly into his captain’s posture. “Be unobtrusive. Use Aria.” Slumping again, he sighed. “You’re right, son. This whole deal hasn’t really lived up to the Brio name. I’ve tried to make it stand for something, but this trip…” Dejection emanated from his bowed head.

The ventilation fans cut off. Mr. Davis folded the mats up against the wall.

His uncle raised his gaze to Emmett’s. His eyes warmed. “Emmett, you’ve done well. I haven’t said—”

A sudden violent wrench of the ship interrupted. Emmett flew across the cabin, crashing against the far wall. Gravity sputtered and pulled. The surging forces pulled and twisted, throwing him across the cabin, then spinning and thrusting him on another vector. Claxons assaulted his ears. His stomach rebelled. In the dim glow of the emergency lights he caught glimpses of the others being hurled around the room. At one point a leg collided with his shoulder, then his head met the edge of the hatch with a thud, sending shooting sparks across his vision. Another lurch, and he heard a sickening thud nearby. Faintly, the claxons drowning it out, he heard “Ow, ow, ow…”. It was his own voice. The wild wrenching continued to tumble him and the others, slamming them into exercise equipment and walls indiscriminately as the ship groaned and roared. Another thrust sent Emmett crashing into something dimly treadmill-shaped. Searing pain hit, then darkness.

## Part 4: Stranded

### Episode 7

#### Chapter 13: Stutter Aftermath

##### Scene 13.1: Emmett in Medbay

“—that trip you and your grandmother and I took to the backcountry? When we saw that wolf? That mouthful of chips you had went every—”

“Un—” Emmett’s raspy whisper caught in a dry, cracked throat. He tried again. “Uncle?”

A comforting pressure fell on Emmett’s hand. “I’m right here, son. Drink this.”

Obligingly Emmett opened his mouth. A straw landed on chapped lips, then a moment later a glad coolness eased his throat. With difficulty, he forced sticky eyelids open only to wince at the brightness of the light. His eyes watered. Cautiously, he turned his throbbing head. “You’re— you’re alright?”

“It’s just a concussion,” his uncle said, patting Emmett’s hand again briefly. “I’ll be fine.” His uncle, his pallor gray and concerning, was perched precariously on a stool next to Emmett.

“Uh—” Emmett forced his sluggish thoughts faster. “—what— what about Mr. Davis?”

“He fractured several ribs, now immobilized.” His uncle gestured around his own rib cage, wobbling on the stool as he did so. “And he’s now coordinating cleanup from the bridge, with Aria’s help.”

With growing awareness, Emmett could hear soft, disturbed movements and sounds of distress around him, the smell of unwashed bodies overriding the smell of antiseptic. Cautiously he moved his head to gaze around the room. Medbay was packed. Colonists filled the few other beds, while more sprawled on the floor or leaned against the wall. Emmett and his uncle, though, seemed cocooned in their own bubble of privacy.

“What happened?”

His uncle’s shoulders sagged, and one hand reached up to restlessly scrub the stubble on his face. His dark eyes wandered over the wall behind Emmett and around the cabin before finally meeting Emmett’s. Dully, he said, “The drive failed, so we exited FTL unexpectedly. In the emergency exit—” His uncle’s speech morphed into the crisp voice of the captain, and he stiffened upright. “—thirteen passengers died.”

It felt like a sucker-punch. Emmett’s chest hurt. He struggled for breath, and his gasps joined the uneasy discordant sounds of medbay. He became aware of the reassuring hush of the ventilation and the ship’s rumble beneath their feet, and his breathing eased.

His uncle sat quietly, listing slightly on the small stool. He had splayed his fingers on the the edge of Emmett’s blanket as if to steady himself. The movement drew Emmett’s attention to the cast on his own leg.

“I— I didn’t even notice.”

His uncle’s posture straightened again. “Two fractures. Broke the bone clear through. Casted. Assorted bruises. Minor cuts. Regeneration drugs, pain meds. Burst sleep to regen next.”

The staccato report chased Emmett as the meds pulled him down into a deep sleep.

##### Scene 13.2: Kaylah in Medbay Realizes Grandma is Dead

<!-- TODO: 2 -->

From where she huddled in a small corner, by one of the medbay cots, Kaylah had heard every word. Tears flooded down her cheeks as the medbay hatch shushed shut behind the captain.

*Dead? Grandma is dead?*

Tears soaked her corduroys. She wrapped her arms around her knees.

*How…?* A sob escaped, and she clamped her mouth firmly, being quiet as she could, determined not to let anyone notice her. She futilely swiped at tears that continued to stream down her face.

Earlier, when the doctor had pushed her off a cot to make way for an injured colonist, she had groggily collapsed into this niche. No one had found her since.

*I just want it all to stop!*

Her arm ached, reminding her of the violent wrenching that had woken her and thrown her against her med cot’s webbing. Some kind of an accident. But what? The ship— The ship must have left FTL…

She stared at a series of scratches on the worn but clean floor at her feet. They shimmered through her tears*. Grandma can’t be dead.* Her mind felt stuffy, thick. She was so tired. *Where’s my dad?*

She drifted off, shivering against the cold metal wall, dozing through a confused jumble of images. Her mom, reading. The nightmare ship drifting. The three of them loading their baggage onboard ship. The last time her grandmother laughed. Mr. Clarke looming over her, cackling like that witch from that weird movie. The house they lived in when she was seven. Her grandmother insisting on the doctor after she fell out of a tree. Her mom, in the kitchen, fussing at her about how she cut an—

“Where’s my daughter?” An angry voice filled medbay. “What have you done with her?”

Pushing off from the wall, she wobbled to her feet. “I’m here, Dad! Here I am!” She waved a hand wildly, ignoring the ache in the other arm.

He enveloped her in a too-tight hug. *Ow!*

“Too tight. Dad, too tight!”

He released her. “Sorry. Are you okay?” he asked, his brow furrowed.

“Of course she is,” sniffed the doctor. “Now, you’re disturbing my patients. Please leave.”

“Come on, Kaylah.”

“No, the patient stays.”

“What? You said she was fine.”

“She is still on the stronger medications. I am keeping an eye on her.”

“Where?” asked her father, with anger, one hand sweeping the entire medbay, filled with injured colonists.

By now, other colonists were awake and watching. Kaylah hung her head and rubbed her arm anxiously, giving her father quick darting looks.

*He’s so angry.*

The doctor gave in. “Oh, take her with you. She’ll need to be at the funeral.”

*The creep!*

“You like bossing people, don’t—”

Kaylah interrupted, taking her dad’s clenched fist and tugging on it. “Let’s go, Dad.” She led him out to the corridor.

“So, uh, you know?” he asked quietly.

“Yeah.”

His shoulders slumped.

“Let’s go get you something to eat. You’re too thin.”

She didn’t argue, but she wasn’t hungry.

*Grandma’s really gone?*

#### Chapter 14: Funerals and Riots

##### Scene 14.1: Funerals

The dirge echoed in the cold corridor. With three other men, Emmett bent down, his cast making movement clumsy. Together, the men picked up the last burden and eased it into the airlock. The violins rose above the brass mournfully. Behind them a group of colonists watched with shell-shocked eyes.

Emmett staggered as the pallbearers stepped back. He caught sight of Mr. Broussard, off to one side, his arm around his little girl’s shoulders. She looked ill and unsteady, a thin whisper of a girl, pale with dark and shadowed eyes.

The ship-side airlock closed, then the outer hatch opened to the blackness of space. The deceased in black body bags lifted and floated out into the vastness. The music ceased.

Somber and subdued, the colonists trudged off. Emmett rubbed his dry, bloodshot eyes; he’d been operating at a driving pace ever since he finished regen in sick bay. Captain Brio’s concussion and the first mate’s broken ribs had slowed the crew’s recovery efforts. Emmett was going on hour forty-seven without sleep, and the stim tabs would wear off soon. But, this was the last funeral. He ran a hand through his tangled, sweat-matted hair. The last funeral.

He lurched off down the corridor, his leg under the cast itching. “One last briefing, then bed,” he mumbled.

##### Scene 14.2: Crew Briefing - Ship Broken, Kaylah's Nightmare Ship

Entering the crew mess for the briefing, an enticing smell greeted Emmett. His mouth watered.

Gingerly, he straddled a stool at the narrow table next to Scully. The engineer’s utilities were grime-encrusted and torn in several places, the rolled-up sleeves exposing hairy, dirt-stained arms. Those same arms formed a base for the engineer’s disheveled head. Snores emerged from the pile, each exhale fluttering the engineer’s beard.

After maneuvering around the table, Mr. Davis handed a second tray of cinnamon rolls to the captain, who settled them in the center of the group. Mr. Davis carefully eased himself into the only straight-backed chair as Emmett and the others gobbled the fresh buns ravenously.

The sugary food, and the coffee Captain Brio delivered, eased his jitters and warmed the edges of the coldness inside.

“Mr. Emmett, where are we?”

The bite in his mouth became cardboard. “About seven hundred light years off-course.”

At the news, in mid-snore Scully jerked upright. “Seven hundred? That much?”

“We did find the system in the survey databases, noted but not charted. The ship’s computer is still crunching numbers and comparing data to try to pinpoint our location. Aria’s supervising and will let us know.” He examined his plate, now empty of even crumbs. “Until we know our location…” He shrugged.

“So?” the doctor said. “Why can’t we just FTL out of here?”

Glaring at the doctor, Scully drawled loudly, “Are you crazy?” His arms now uncrossed, muscles clenching, the engineer leaned toward the doctor.

“More coffee, Scully?” asked Mr. Davis mildly.

Shaking himself like a bear after a rain, Scully answered, “No, thanks, Mike.” He added, more calmly, to the doctor, “We can’t fire up the FTL without knowing where we are more precisely. But, that’s not our chief problem.” The engineer paused to flex his hands, examining the cuts and scrapes as if they were alien markings.

They waited. The doctor had stuffed so much of the last of the rolls in his mouth that he looked like a chipmunk. He looked ridiculous.

“An evil chipmunk,” thought Emmett. He choked back an inappropriate giggle.

“The last Sang-Ook controller shattered, and— and, uh…” The sound of Sully clearing his throat was like a growl. “And, uh, it’s not repairable.”

In the quiet Emmett could hear the doctor chewing. “Chipmunk,” Emmett thought, a little hysterically.

With the news the cargomaster’s hand had frozen, his mouth wide open, the bite of cinnamon roll falling off his fork and plopping on his plate. The captain was a statue, while Mr. Davis’ hands lay flat on the table, as if holding it down. Emmett pressed his sticky palms against his hot, irritated eyes, and leaned his elbows on the table. His leg ached. He was so very tired.

“Not repairable?” asked the captain.

“No.”

“Surely you could cobble—” the doctor waved a dismissive hand in the air.

“No. I. Cannot,” said the engineer, his drawl disappearing as he spaced each word, enunciating each word. His fists clenched again.

“Huh, h-huh. The Sang-Ook wasn’t so much,” chortled the cargo master. He subsided at the blank looks the others gave him, muttering, “Sang-Ook. Always well. Sang-Ook. Always well—”

“So we’re stuck here?” whined the doctor.

“No. Not stuck,” the captain answered. “We will solve the problem.”

Mr. Davis asked, “Mr. Emmett, how are the colonists after the last funeral?”

“Mrs. Broussard was in this bunch, wasn’t she?” the doctor questioned. “How sad for the little girl,” he added with such false sincerity, with that disturbing gleam, that Emmett’s own fists clenched, and he stiffened. The movement banged his cast into the small table, sloshing everyone’s coffee and sending pain shooting through his leg. He gritted his teeth and briefly closed his eyes, then opened them.

The cargomaster dove to clean up the spill.

“Sorry,” said Emmett.

“How is the girl?” asked the captain.

“The stronger medication I have given her has kept her quiet and kept her from disturbing other passengers.”

“Only during the night shift, correct?” asked the captain mildly.

“Well, you understand, of course, the medication is strong. The effects, unfortunately—” the doctor’s voice seemed almost gleeful “—make her groggy. And I’m worried about the hostility of the other passengers,” he added sanctimoniously. “So, she’s in the medbay. I had to insist.”

Emmett almost blurted out that she had been at the funeral, but after his captain’s reaming he was not going to talk about the little girl unless he had to. Had to. He rubbed his temples, groaning as he remembered. He was so tired. Dread rose up in him like waves crashing on the shore.

“It doesn’t make sense. Except—” he whispered out loud.

“Mr. Emmett?”

“Huh? Captain?”

“Were you saying something?”

“Um…” Emmett shredded the remaining roll in front of him into bits. “Something odd, sir.”

“How so?”

“In between funerals I took a look at the data.” The pile of shredded roll grew. “This star system—” He sighed. “Well, it’s unusual. A binary system, a very unique one. Aria assures me that no other star in the database is like it.”

“So?”

“Well, you know, Aria has befriended several of the colonists…” Emmett hesitated, looking away from the captain. “Including, uh, the youngest child onboard.”

“The nightmare kid we were just talking about?” asked the cargomaster.

“Mr. Renshaw, let’s not label her like that, shall we?” Mr. Davis said mildly as he collected a third tray of the rolls.

Scully had lowered his head to rest again on his arms.

“Yes, the nightmares.” Emmett paused for another swig of coffee. He straightened to say more formally, “Aria, in expanding her medical knowledge, has been pursuing therapy with young Ms. Broussard to help her with the nightmares. Part of that was recreating her nightmares.” He flicked an image onto the wall viewscreen. “This is the model they came up with for the first nightmare.”

“What does this have to do with anything?” complained the doctor.

“Quiet!” The captain snapped at the doctor, before gesturing for Emmett to continue.

“And this is the binary star of this system.” Another image joined the first.

Mr. Davis’s eyes widened, flicking from model to image, side-by-side. “They’re… they’re both binary star systems.” He stood, wincing a little as he did so, and, with eyes fixed on the images, edged around the chairs for a closer examination. “They look… they look alike. Very much alike.”

“Aria says—” Emmett swallowed. “She says they match.”

“What do you mean, match?” demanded Scully.

Aria answered, chiming in softly. “Ms. Broussard’s model matches the binary stars of this system to a high degree. Would you like an an-depth analysis?”

“Not now,” said the captain, staring at the screen, a look of growing wonder on his usually stoic face.

The cargomaster’s face had paled. “Impossible!”

Scully rested his head again on his folded arms. The ventilation fans kicked on. The warm, rich scent of the rolls swirled and faded around the crew.

“Stranger things have happened out here,” mused the first mate.

The captain nodded acknowledgment, his eyes still on the display.

“There’s more.”

“More?” Mr. Davis asked, startled.

“Proceed, Mr. Emmett.” With his gaze still focused on the images on screen, the captain waved one hand at Emmett.

Emmett flashed a new image on screen. “Aria and Ms. Broussard also modeled a ship, a derelict, from Ms. Broussard’s nightmare of the binary—”

The doctor waved a hand. “Bah! Nonsense. A child’s dreams.”

Mr. Davis lifted an eyebrow at the doctor, pausing before saying mildly, “The stars matched. Why couldn’t the ship?”

“Ship?” Scully raised his head and studied the screen. “Looks like an Aldrin-class.”

“Would it work?”

“Could. It would-ah carried a Sang-Ook. Doesn’t look like it’s been salvaged.”

“There’s that dwarf planet behind it, close in.” Mr. Davis noted.

“Yes, that matches the modeling, as well,” said Mr. Emmett.

They all stared at the images.

“What next?” Mr. Davis asked quietly.

“We head in-system,” the captain responded.

##### Scene 14.3: Ship-wide Meeting and Riot

With a a professional expression plastered on his face, Emmett warily stood next to Mr. Davis.

The trip had been hard on the colonists. Crammed together, low water rations, the very real dangers — all had taken their toll. And then had come the stutter, and the deaths.

Now, gathered in the rec hold, dirty and disheveled, they were a sorry-looking bunch. Aria was tracking a rise in mental instability among the passengers. Health measures were losing efficacy, and the danger of violence among the passengers was rising.

“Can you look a little friendlier, Emmett?” asked the first mate, his mouth barely moving, his attention fixed on the crowd. “You look constipated.”

Emmett forced his lips into a smile.

“Never mind. You’ll scare the children.”

“What children?” argued Emmett in a angry whisper, not turning his head. He, too, was focused on the crowd. “The only child is in medbay.”

The first mate sighed.

Mrs. Holang-Lee finished her spiel and waved the microphone over to hover in front of Mr. Davis.

“Thank you all for coming.” The first mate’s warm voice spread out over the crowd, but his friendliness dissipated over the ever-growing restlessness of the crowd. A frisson of unease crawled up Emmett’s spine.

“We wanted to update you personally. Yes, the ship did experience a part failure, throwing us out of FTL unexpectedly. We, the crew, are working hard to put this ship back into FTL and heading toward Heinlein Station—”

“I heard we’re stuck here!”

“I assure you—”

“Ass for sure.” Snickers and grumbles rippled across the crowd with an ugly undertone.

Almost unconsciously, Emmett shifted his weight to the balls of his feet.

“Why are we heading deeper into the system?” called a voice. Emmett’s aunt had always said there were no secrets onboard ship.

Another colonist shoved his way forward, almost pushing a taller woman over. The taller woman caught her balance, then shoved the man back, hard. They glared at each other.

“We are headed deeper in-system because to help us navigate our way out of this system,” Mr. Davis answered adroitly.

“How do we know you’re telling the truth?”

“Well—”

“We are all going to die!”

“Not dying is—”

“I WANNA SHOWER!” yelled a man, incongruously, who then, with eyes rolling wildly, charged Mr. Davis. Cautious of his ribs, Mr. Davis adroitly side-stepped, and tripped the man, spilling him onto the floor. Emmett kneeled and grasped the man’s right arm to force it behind his back.

Behind them another colonist was laughing and pointing at the fallen man. The laughter was edging into hysteria.

“You think that’s funny?” one of the veterinarians called out. “I’ll show you funny!” He swung at the hysterical man. Just like that, fighting broke out, spreading across the hold.

The man underneath Emmett was now sobbing quietly.

In his in-ear, Aria’s voice was glissading\[\[ Word choice\]\] down notes. “…25, 24, 23—”

Emmett looked up at Mr. Davis. The firt mate gestured at the exit with a slight tilt of his head. Together, they broke out into at a run.

Mr. Davis, ducking a punch from a colonist, skidded to a stop to roar at the colonist, “Mr. Broussard! What would your daughter think?”

Kaylah’s father looked at the first mate, an angry dullness in his eyes.

Behind them the fighting grew worse.

“Come. Right now!” Mr. Davis grabbed the man’s arm. A spark lit the blankness of the man’s expression as Mr. Davis dragged him toward the door. Stumbling, Broussard followed them through the hatch just before Mr. Davis slammed it shut.

“Aria?”

“Mass sedation protocols engaged, Mr. Davis.”

“Is the doctor on his way?”

Her lyrical voice flattened. “No.”

“Kit,” said Emmett, trotting down the corridor to the nearby emergency bin. Behind him he could hear the metal flooring clank as Mr. Broussard shuffled away.

“Emmett, you’ll be checking out the colonists for adverse reactions to the noise barrage or the gas.” A muscle in the first mate’s jaw twitched. “I’ll check in on the doctor.”

“Of course, sir.” Emmett hesitated, shifting his weight. “What are we going to do? We can’t just keeping gassing all of the colonists. But… They’re really losing it, sir.”

“Do you blame them?” asked the first mate, raising one eyebrow at him.

“No, but what are we going to do?”

Baring his teeth, the first mate answered, “We survive, Mr. Emmett. We survive.”

### Episode 8: EVA, Recovery, Celebration

#### Chapter 15: Derelict and EVA Prep

##### Scene 15.1: Medbay Conflict

Voices pierced her grogginess. She raised her head wearily from where she slumped, tucked into her tiny corner of medbay.

“This is unacceptable!”

It was the first mate’s voice. She peered around the corner of the nearest pallet.

Mr. Davis leaned in, forcing the doctor to look up at him. “You are contractually on-call for all shipboard events.”

The doctor shrugged. “This isn’t the first time you gassed the colonists. Like I said before, no rush needed.”

“Doctor, do your job. I am ordering you to to take care of your contracted responsibilities in a timely manner. Do your job.”

”They’ll riot again, you’ll gas them again, they’ll recover.”

That doctor… Kaylah refused to use his name. *He’s a jerk. Wait, riots? When did that start happening?*

The first mate’s face was actually turning a reddish purple color. *Wow, he’s always so calm and friendly.*

“Doctor, you are treading on dangerous ground.”

“I am not afraid of you,” sneered the doctor.

Mr. Davis stretched a hand languorously toward the doctor, who flinched. Mr. Davis gripped the doctor’s shoulder, leaning in even closer. “Ah, but I’m not the one you should be afraid of,” said Mr. Davis in a voice low in volume but edged with steel. He meticulously patted smooth the lapel of the doctor’s coat, and smiled a smile that sent chills down Kaylah’s spine before turning and stalking out.

*The doctor looked… odd. Is… is he scared? No, it’s like that tiger in that documentary, finding a moose instead of a mouse.*

She shuddered, and ducked back behind the med cot, shrinking back into her huddle. “No tigers for me, no tigers for me,” she mumbled. *I miss Grandma. I don’t know if Dad’s okay. Where is he?* Tears dripped down across her knuckles, between her fingers, and onto her bent knees. She swiped at her wet face the back of one shaky hand and leaned against the cold metal corner. *Where are we? Why did they say the ship stopped? I’m so tired. I can’t… Think—* She drifted back into a doze.

##### Scene 15.2: Derelict is Found By Drones

Like a giant’s toy that had been ripped apart, the derelict tumbled across the huge viewscreen on the bridge. Its two larger halves were surrounded by a cloud of smaller debris.

The crew were at their usual stations, accompanied by Scully, who bounced up and down on the balls of his feet behind Emmett.

“A nasty hit.” The engineer’s eyebrows pulled to together in puzzlement, looking like a black bushy caterpillar. “What did they run into?”

“Or what ran into them?” Mr. Davis added.

“A meteor?” asked Emmett.

“Maybe…” said Scully doubtfully. “But it’s definitely an Aldrin-class. Right, Aria?”

“I concur.”

The metal floor underneath them vibrated and creaked under the engineer’s rocking motion. “Captain, it’s likely to have at least one Sang-Ook.”

“Yes, indeed, Mr. Scully.”

“Aria, salvageable?”

“Simulations indicate factors are within acceptable parameters.”

“I concur, captain,” added Mr. Davis, a formal note in his voice.

“Thank you. Aria, claim and protocols?”

“Claim recorded as of two hours ago. Protocols engaged… now.”

Emmett toggled the protocols display, watching as mapping data from the ship’s sensors rolled in. His eyes flicked to the drone telemetry window; Aria was queuing the survey drones.

The captain squinted at the large screen. “Alright. Work party. Scully—”

“Yes!” The engineer pumped one fisted, hairy arm in the air. “Field trip!”

“—Emmett, and myself,” Captain Brio finished.

Mr. Davis objected. “Captain—”

“Cracked ribs, Mr. Davis.”

“But the suit will hold—”

“No.”

The first mate subsided with a frown.

Neither had suggested the cargomaster. Even Emmett knew that the likable Ren had a fear of open space. An odd fear for a crewmember of spaceship, but the man could find the best ROI in cargo, then fit it tighter into the holds than anyone.

“Only you would consider a work party EVA a field trip, Scully.” Ren’s voice emerged from soft static over the ship’s coms. “Better you than me.”

“Mr. Emmett, have you chosen an orbit near the derelict?”

“Yes, captain.”

“Make it so.”

Mr. Davis laughed, saying something about picks, and the captain grinned, a grin so fleeting Emmett wasn’t sure he had seen it.

And the ship dove deeper into the system.

##### Scene 15.3: At the Derelict, Pre-EVA

With the in-system drive, it had taken days to reach the dwarf planet. Now, after orbit and drone deployments, analysis was complete, or at least complete enough. On the bridge telemetry, video, and projections played across the wide expanse.

“Report?” asked the captain.

“The tumble and rotation are within safe parameters,” Emmett replied.

“Aria?”

A happy melody rolled through Aria’s words. “Simulations fall within acceptable ranges, captain.”

“We can match orbit and rotation, captain,” Scully said.

“Structural integrity?”

The crew on the bridge as one stared at the captain. Behind them the two larger pieces of the wreck slowly tumbled across the screen as telemetry flowed over the image.

Patiently, the captain added, “Of the stern piece, where the Sang-Ook would be?”

“Um, yes, captain.” Scully turned back to point at the other ship’s stern as it slowly rotated on the screen. “Looks good. With the one drone we, ah, inserted inside, the path looks navigable to where we think the engine compartment is. Structurally, getting there looks good. Don’t know what’s behind the compartment hatch, though. The hatches show as sealed.”

“Preparations?”

“Complete. We’re ready, sir.”

“EVA party, initiate.”

#### Chapter 16: Medbay Help and EVA Success

##### Scene 16.1: Kaylah in Medbay, Amy Helps

“Hurts,” she tried to mumble. The surface beneath felt hard. The bright lights, even through her eyelids, inflamed the sparks of pain shooting through her skull. Her stomach felt worse.

“Doctor?” her father’s voice, anxious and worried, came from somewhere on her right.

“Oh, she’s fine. The medication keeps her sedated.”

“But...”

“I said, she’s fine.”

“Perhaps he could give her some water,” Aria suggested.

“I don’t need your help,” snapped the doctor. “But, yes, yes, he can do that much. Bottle and straw there.”

Her head pounded. She tried again to speak. No one noticed.

“Here, Kaylah.”

She felt a straw inserted into her mouth. She tried to swallow, her tongue thick and dry.

“Come on, drink it, honey,” said her father. He gave the bottle a squeeze.

The rush of water was too much. Coughing tore through her throat, causing her headache to spike. She couldn’t get enough air.

“Kaylah? Something’s wrong!” Her father yelled.

Rushing footsteps approached.

“Amy?” Jonah’s voice materialized by her left ear.

“She’s choking on the water.”

Strong arms leveraged her into a sitting position.

“Kaylah?”

Between coughs she forced a bleary eye open to see Amy looking at her in concern.

“Here, Mr. Broussard, just thump her on the back. No, more gently.”

All she could do was to struggle for air and fight the pain. It took a few minutes for her to realize Jonah was holding her up.

“What a mess,” complained the doctor.

“Kaylah, can you hear me?” asked Amy.

She cracked an eye open a slit, only to close it reflexively.

“Dimming lights,” Aria stated.

“Thank you,” murmured the Amy absently. “Just a little cleanup, don’t worry,” she said to Kaylah. “Do you hurt?”

She tried to nod, which caused white hot pain to lance through her torso, stabbing inside her head. She wobbled sideways, into her dad’s broad shoulders.

“Okay, just blink. One blink for yes, two for no. Understand?”

She forced her eyes open and blinked. A tear of pain slipped out.

“Okay, let’s try to figure it out. Hang in there!”

“She’s just trying for—” said the doctor.

“Mr. Davis wants to see you, Doctor.” interrupted Aria.

“Now?”

“Yes, doctor.”

“I have a patient.”

*No! Don’t… don’t let him…*

“Sorry, doctor, he said now,” insisted Aria.

Despite the pain still burning through her insides, Kaylah relaxed.

Amy said, “Aria, can you walk me through a basic exam?”

*Not…* Kaylah tried again, her voice raspy. “Not a cow.”

Amy chuckled. “Yeah, you are human!” Her long hair swished past Kaylah’s ear. “I’ll tell you a secret.” She lowered his voice. “I can’t stand the doctor, either.”

Kaylah felt her mouth crack upwards, but then Amy’s probing hands hit a spot in her stomach, and she lurched upward, her stomach rebelling, and spewed vomit into a steel bowl that had appeared like magic.

“What’s wrong with her?” demanded her father.

“Aria?”

“The scan shows inflammation in the liver and digestive tract,” answered Aria, her voice flat. “Mr. Broussard?”

“What?”

“Please clean off her face with a damp cloth.”

“Good idea, Aria. Mr. Broussard, it will help her be more comfortable.”

The cool cloth did feel good, even in her dad’s inexpert hands.

“Why is she so sick?”

Amy answered her dad. “I think she has a stomach bug — according to Aria and the scan, anyways.” She hesitated. “And, well, I think the meds she’s on are a little too strong. The meds may be irritating her stomach and digestive tract.”

Her dad’s voice sounded lost. “Will she be okay?”

“She needs an IV line to rehydrate her, and some anti-inflammatory pain meds.”

“Oh… That’s good.” Her father sounded dazed.

“But I’m not allowed to hook up the IV,” said Amy patiently. “I work with animals, not humans. And I’m only in training. I won’t be a vet for years.”

Kaylah’s stomach clenched. Pain spiked. A moan escaped.

“We need to do something,” Jonah said firmly. “Aria, help?”

“Checking protocols,” she murmured in response.

Kaylah’s face contorted as again pain clenched in her torso, rays of burning pain shooting into her legs and chest.

“You are now authorized by shipboard authority 2-Alpha...”

A few minutes later Kaylah, soothed and cooled — in comfort, for the first time in a long time — drifted off to sleep.

##### Scene 16.2: EVA at the Wreck

The EVA party approached the wreck, the warmth from the sun fading as they entered the shadow of the dwarf planet. Lights from each of the three-thrusted mules flicked on, shining off twisted pieces of metal.

The captain’s lights illuminated large letters on the side of the stern as Scully said, “The drone feed didn’t quite get all this debris. Any ideas?”

“Aria.” The captain’s voice sounded flat and tinny over Emmett’s suit com. He started ticking off seconds in his head, timing the com delay.

“Yes, captain?”

“Her name has an u, s, and possibly another u. Our imaging sent.”

“Combining visuals,” murmured Aria over the com. “Searching.”

Emmett shifted restlessly in the seat of the mule, his gloved fingers twitching the handles as the auto-pilot pulled his mule forward, following Scully’s mule, which had fired its thrusters to match the rotation of the derelict’s stern. As his mule moved forward, light played from behind him, cast from the headlights of the captain’s mule, throwing his elongated shadow forward. Twisting in his seat aboard the mule, ignoring the resulting ache in his leg, Emmett could see the tiny speck of Brio’s Hope, gleaming in the light of the binary star, light that reached feebly into the blackness.

“Mr. Emmett.” The captain’s came on his com. “Watch the edges.”

A frisson of fear sparked down Emmett’s spine. He focused again on the shifting debris, and inched his mule forward carefully. Although the auto-plow drone sent hours ago had cleared a route, the mass of sharp metal edges on either side of them glinted in the mules’ headlights as it shifted and eddied.

Mules were not known for strong protective fields. Emmett concentrated.

Eventually, they tethered the mules outside the airlock and entered the wreck. Yellow heart rate warnings flashed in Emmett’s suit, so he forced himself to deep, slow breaths. The other two experienced crewmen moved in slow choreography, their telemetry steady in the green.

“Status on the doctor, Mr. Davis?” the captain asked, as if it were a normal day. Silence of the time-lag filled the coms. Emmett followed Scully’s thumping steps down the corridor. Light from Scully’s headlamp spiraled around the corridor tube from ceiling to floor as he examined the wreckage for dangers. The captain was walking backwards close to Scully, slowly but easily, his steps in unison with the engineer. He, too, scanned the corridor from ceiling and floor, watching their back trail and setting his feet with ponderous precision. Emmett knew, from past training, that both were also scanning camera feeds inside the suit helms. It was like an elaborate dance in slow motion. It impressed Emmett to no end. He followed, practicing the head roll that illuminated ceiling to floor and in that slow spiral. They worked their way deeper into the ship.

“Aria is still monitoring him closely. No big issues yet,” the first mate answered the captain. “I think we’ll manage until the station, God willing.”

“How many passengers still in medbay?”

The trio had found a bend in the corridor, their boots thudding as they stepped carefully up the side of the round tube to avoid a pile of debris.

“We have reached the bend, Mr. Davis.”

“The two left in medbay? The most severely injured. And Ms. Broussard.”

The static on the coms hissed.

“Copy the bend.”

The slow and steady thump-thump of their boots progressed down the corridor.

“We’re here,” announced Scully. “I think.” He frowned. “They did some custom work. Not the original Aldrin layout. Now that we’re here…” Scully sounded doubtful.

Aria’s lilted in theirs. “Analysis shows…” She paused. “The door is stuck.”

Emmett turned a snort into a cough.

“You see, kid, analysis first. That’s how you know any structural damage before going in, especially if the seal is broken.” As Scully talked he was already pulling a crowbar with its laser lead from his pack. The captain did the same.

“Sensors cannot penetrate. Structural integrity not guaranteed.”

“Copy sensors, copy integrity,” responded the captain.

“Then, we get into position.”

“Clamper, forward,” instructed the captain, and Emmett trudged up the side of the corridor, his boots magnetically thumping each step.

“Remember that time on the keel-hauler, Captain?” Scully queried.

The captain was warming up the crowbar. Reaching over, Emmett attached the clamp to the middle of the hatch and hooked the tether to his glove.

“That hatch flew off like a bullet.”

“Very large bullet.” The captain’s slight nod flared his helmet’s light up and down the hatch.

Emmett lifted one boot clear of the metal floor. His aching leg complained. Placing the boot on the wall, he began thumping his way to the ceiling.

“That yahoo didn’t stand clear like we told him.” Scully spread his feet wider, his boots thumping with a vibration Emmett felt through his suit.

“The ship is the Jusur,” sang Aria in their ears. “The crew was mostly Islamic, out of New Mecca. It carried supplies for the stations out on the Rim.”

“Poor souls. Hard to lose a ship,” Mr. Davis said.

The captain said nothing.

“What happened to him?” Emmett asked. He shifted his grip on the tether as he moved closer to the ceiling.

“Who?”

“The yahoo?”

“Oh, him. The bugger crapped it.”

Emmett swallowed hard. He finished positioning over the door, clamping the other end of the tether to the corridor’s ceiling. He tightened it.

“Go, in three.” The captain grunted.

Inserting the crowbars with their glowing ends, the two older men strained together. In unison, they pulled their crowbars out and reinserted further up the hatch. They repeated, again and again.

“That’s got it.” With one final choreographed pry, the men popped the door popped off. They eased the hatch to one side, opposite the way they came in, and pivoted back to the hatch.

They stopped, a sudden, jarring action, Scully’s torso rocking back and forward again.

“Oh, my God!”

The engineer’s exclamation had Emmett moving to belly down over the hatch.

Two men were staring inside. Suit telemetry flared upwards. Emmett curled around over the top edge and looked inside.

He reeled back in horror.

Bodies. Many bodies. All stuffed in together. In pieces, mixed with debris.

Bile climbed his throat. Dimly he could hear the captain. “Aria, full alert. Wide-sweep.”

“Yes, captain. Full alert.”

Meanwhile, Scully had activated Emmett’s boot overrides and grabbed Emmett, expertly pinning him to the steel wall just outside the hatch. “Emmett Emmett!” he barked. “Look at me!”

Emmett’s horror-filled gaze caught on Scully’s face, shadowed inside the helmet.

Nausea climbed higher.

“Breathe!” Scully insisted. “In, slowly, out slowly.”

“Do not vomit! That’s an order!” The captain’s voice thundered in Emmett’s suit com.

Emmett fought the nausea for what seemed like hours.

“How are his vitals, captain? Back to the ship?”

“No…” Emmett whispered. “I’m… I can handle it.” He managed a deep breath, then another, and another. His breathing evened out and deepened. His self-telemetry in his helmet eased back into yellow, but the entire suit monitor was outlined in flashing red.

“Full…” He swallowed. “Alert?”

“Buddy boy,” Scully said gently, loosening his hold on Emmett’s suited arm. “They’ve all been shot high-caliber splatter guns.”

“What? Are you sure?”

The captain spoke. “No mistaking that kind of damage.” His voice warmed. “Mr. Emmett? Shall we continue?”

Emmett shoved that glimpse of horror away and focused on his captain. “Yes, sir.” Nausea settled in his stomach like a slow, low fire. “Do… do we go in there?”

“No,” replied Scully flatly.

“Scully?”

“It’s not engineering; that must be the next hatch down.”

His stomach burned. Emmett wished he could un-see what he saw.

“Seal the hold.”

“Captain?” Scully asked, blinking the EVA time remaining in everyone’s suit telemetry.

“Seal it.”

Replacing and welding the hatch took precious time.

“Protocols mean we leave them here, doesn’t it?” asked Emmett. “It doesn’t seem right.”

“We’ll report the wreck when we get back.”

“I know it’s protocol, but— it doesn’t seem—”

“Well, it’s gonna mess with our salvage claim,” Scully muttered.

“Move on.”

“Yes, captain.” The three moved into single file and went on. At the second door off the corridor, they all braced themselves. This time, even the older two men’s heart rates were up.

“Easy,” the captain reminded. “Breathe.”

Emmett watched the higher heart rates ease, his trailing the two experienced men.

This time, the hatch came away with more force and slammed to the end of the tether.

Empty — of people, anyway. The hallmark pipework and conduit snaked around the drive and engine.

“Yep, engineering,” Scully announced unnecessarily. His head down, he trudged into the room. Within minutes, his suited arms and helmet had disappeared into a cabinet. His legs dangled out. A low rumble of grumbling complaints from the engineer issued.

Emmett and the captain swept the room, their heads nodding as they swung helmet cams up and down, surveying the rows and rows of orderly compartments fitted around conduits and pipes radiating out from the engine.

“Status?”

“One Sang-Ook confirmed, captain, and maybe more in stores.”

“Which one?” asked the captain.

“The storage label will look like a large comma followed by something like the word ‘lick’ without the ‘k’, then a backwards comma and the word ‘ha’” drawled Scully.

“You know Arabic?” asked Emmett.

The captain was already checking labels. “Scully knows about twenty languages, last count, right Scully?”

Emmett moved to follow the captain’s example, checking labels on the far side of the room.

The engineer wormed his way back out of the opening. “About 12 languages for mostly engineering terms. The other languages? Well… call it bar talk.”

“So you don’t actually speak the other languages?”

“Not all of them. Just about 8 or so.”

“Huh,” said Emmett. Even with all the training his family had poured into him, he spoke only three fluently.

Scully squirmed his way out of the cabinet out to then stand triumphantly, with a device up over his head in victory. The large box, trailing wires, looked innocuous enough.

“Do not dance.”

Scully protested, “Wasn’t going to, captain.” He added, “Not this time.”

Emmett gave up deciphering the Arabic script and started opening each compartment systematically.

“Found it,” the captain announced. They gathered around the bin, Scully tucking the first Sang-Ook in his suited arm like a rather large baby.

“The grandmother lode!” Scully exclaimed at the stacked boxes.

“Emmett, tractor these out.”

“Yes, sir.”

They clunked their way back and forth, studiously ignoring the now-sealed hatch and its freshly-painted universal search-and-rescue sign for the dead. Within minutes, they had created a mini-parade of Sang-Ook devices piled on counter-tractors, leashed to each mule.

Aria chimed in the suit coms. “Ten minutes.”

Soon they were threading their way back through the wreckage.

“Eddies reported,” Aria warned.

The clear path through the twisted metal was losing definition around the edges. A few shards had started to spin lazily into their path, glinting in the headlights of the mules.

“Careful,” warned the captain tersely.

They threaded their way carefully through the wreckage and emerged from the debris field. The EVA time, now switched to a countdown, started to glow yellow in Emmett’s suit monitor. Over the com, he heard the captain command succinctly, “Gun it!”

They burned toward Brio’s Hope, a shining beacon of light in the darkness of space.

Home.

#### Chapter 17: Freedom and Party

##### Scene 17.1: Kaylah Rescued from Medbay

Loud noises woke Kaylah. “Huh?” she whispered. Groggily, she tried again. “What’s going on?” Her voice, weak and raspy, was lost in the shouting.

“…have rights!” yelled the doctor. “You can’t do this. I’m—”

“In breach of contract,” said the captain, his voice crisp, even, and slow.

She curled up, propping her head up with one hand to watch. In her com she could hear Aria faintly in the background, playing a triumphant, almost giddy melody.

The captain, Mr. Davis, and Mr. Emmett had crowded into the medbay. Mr. Emmett had the doctor restrained in an armlock.

*This is interesting*. Warmth flooded her, and her shoulders eased downward.

“I repeat, we have documented proof of negligence, ethical violations, and more. By section 4.7 of the contract, section 4297.301 of interstellar law, and my authority as captain, we are sequestering you for the rest of the voyage.”

“What?” screamed the doctor. He started kicking, his legs flailing helplessly in the first mate’s half-nelson.

“Mr. Davis, lock him up.”

“Gladly, sir.”

She smiled. *Maybe I can get the video of that from Aria later*. She eased back on her pallet, covering her eyes with one arm to block the light.

“Ms. Broussard?” Mr. Emmett’s soft voice. “Are you in pain?”

“Um…”

“The stomach bug better?”

She tilted her head slightly in acknowledgment.

“Brain still foggy?” he asked sympathetically.

“Better,” she whispered.

“Good.”

“Yes.” she nodded. She opened her eyes and winced again.

“Headache?”

“Too bright?” he asked.

Careful not to move her head, she gave him an affirmative thumbs up. Sounds of an IV bag being rolled near caught her attention.

“No…” she protested.

The lights dimmed. “It’s alright,” he soothed. “This is for flushing the drugs out of your system. Okay?”

*They’re actually going to take me off the meds?* She considered the IV. *What if they’re lying? What’s going to happen to me off the meds? I’m scared. Where is my dad?*

“It’s a slow process. Stopping all at once would be too hard on your system.”

“Where—” her tongue stuttered. It felt thick. “—Where is my dad?”

“In your quarters.”

Huh? “Is it our sleep-shift?”

“No, he’s shifting your things to your new quarters.”

She blinked. “Huh?”

“We’re giving you two a private cabin. Well, a very small private cabin.”

“Oh, oh, oh—” she started crying.

“Now, none of that,” he said, alarmed.

“Thank you, thank you, thank you…”

“Thank Mr. Davis. He’s doubling up with Scully. And Scully snores.”

“I don’t— I don’t want to be a problem.”

“You are not a problem. And don’t worry about Mr. Davis; he doesn’t stir from sleep for anything less than an aria from Aria.”

A slight smile tilted up on her face.

“Let’s let your system purge the medications, okay? I’ll check in with you later.”

Relieved, she settled back on the med cot. Our own separate quarters. *That will be great. Grandma will—* Her brain stuttered. She forced her thoughts elsewhere. *Wait, where will they put the doctor? No, wait I don’t care where. As long he’s not around me.* Comforted, she snuggled under the covers.

##### Scene 17.2: Colonist Party

Glittering specks flew toward him. He dove for the hatch, almost catching himself on the edge, but the expanding cloud caught him, showering him.

“Yo! It’s my pilot man!” One of the xenobiologists wobbled closer. As Emmett straightened from his crouch outside the hatch to the cargo hold, the other man thumped Emmett’s shoulder enthusiastically.

He smiled politely. With a vigorous shake, he dislodged some of the confetti caught in his curly hair. It fell to the floor of the hold in a coruscating shower as he surveyed the crowded rec hold.

Colonists partied with a giddiness that would not be denied. One group was back to boisterously dancing in square patterns. At the far end a band was belting out a fast-paced hip hop song with a bass beat and a strong guitar carrying the melody. The song reminded Emmett vaguely of his grandfather.

The xenobiologist wandered off, calling to a colleague. A gaggle of women staggered over. A younger woman, close to his age, shouted, “Meeeester Feeeesherrr!”

“Hello, Ms. Rossi,” he said, with a genuine smile. “Nice dress.”

She ran her hands along the sides of the dress and giggled. “Thanks.” A quick moue, then she added, “It’s Benedetta, remember?” Her friends were now giggling, too, sipping on some kind of bubbly drink.

She moved in closer to Emmett.

“Enjoying yourself?” asked Emmett, tilting his head.

“Yeeeessss!!” The woman pumped a fist. “Heinlein Station, here we come!!”

“You sound ready for the station.”

“Read—” She hiccuped. “—ready to get off the ship.”

“Was it pirates?” another colonist asked.

Emmett was still admiring Benedetta. “Um, the Jusur?”

“The Jusur?” They looked confused. “Oh, the ship.” The same woman crowded in closer. “Yes, that’s the one. Tell us all about it.”

“We sealed the ship. It will keep until official investigators get there. I can’t speak as to the investigation at this time.” A quick flashback to that scene of horror when the hatch had opened hit him, and he forced it away.

He added, “There’s no need to worry. This is the last stop, then Heinlein Station, then we reach your new—”

“But what about that girl’s nightmares? I heard—”

“Excuse me, ladies.”

“Don’t go.” Benedetta tightened her grip on his arm and tugged him. She leaned in. “Come join us for the party.”

He pulled his arm out of her grip with some difficulty. “Later, ladies, I’m due somewhere shortly.”

He headed again for the buffet, the women’s giggling following him. He passed by a poker game.

“Hey, hey, hey, Emmett!” said one, raising his glass. “Cheers on the repairs!” The others echoed the toast.

He nodded, and kept moving. His stomach rumbled.

The diminutive assistant director intercepted him. “Last water stop, Mr. Emmett, eh?”

“Yes, Mrs. Holang-Lee. Except for when we fill up at Heinlein station.”

A distant, far-away longing appeared in her eyes. “Home.” She shook her head slightly as if to clear her thoughts. “I heard about the Jusur. Are you okay?”

He swallowed, forcing back the surge of memories. “Yes, Mrs. Holang-Lee. Thanks for asking.”

He passed on by. He could feel her watching as he walked away. He reached the buffet and started piling on the food. A couple of professors were already there, grazing the buffet, with Mr. Clarke.

“Is it true, Mr. Emmett?” Mr. Clarke asked, showing Emmett a mouthful of mashed pretzels.

“Is what true?” He carefully piled another couple of spoonfuls of food onto his plate.

“That little girl’s nightmares — she saw that ship?”

Emmett sighed. “What ship?”

“Don’t play dumb.” Mr. Clarke frowned. “That derelict you all found the parts in. I hear that she saw that ship long before we found it, in those crazy nightmares. Is it true?”

“Ah, no comment, Mr. Clarke. Are you ready for Heinlein Station?” he deflected.

“If we survive this water stop,” griped the older man.

A reminder chimed in his com.

“Will you excuse me? I’m out of time.”

“Here, have this,” he said to the botanist behind him, handing off the plate. “I have to be on bridge.”

##### Scene 17.3: Kaylah Feted

“Come on, Kaylah, you need food,” urged her father. They pressed on into the crowd, aiming for the cafeteria area.

The rec hold was bright. And loud. And smelly. After all that time in medbay, she had forgotten, but a faint scent of cinnamon rolls teased and offered contrast.

“Look, it’s her!”

Someone started clapping. Others joined in.

“Kaylah! Kaylah! Kaylah!” they chanted.

She winced at their exuberance. “What is this?” she whispered under her breath. As people closed in around them, she huddled closer to her dad, who guided her, one arm around her shoulders, toward the food.

“You saved us!”

“Mr. Broussard, how long has your daughter had this gift?”

“How did you know it was the same ship?”

“Here, have a cinnamon roll.”

She took the plate thrust at her. “Uh, thank you?”

“Kaylah! Have you always had dreams like this?”

The voices went on and on. Dazed, all she could do was blink.

Jonah and Amy appeared like magic. Jonah forcibly turned her father around and pushed toward the exit, and Amy urged Kaylah to follow. Confused, Kaylah worked her way back through the crowd as Amy helped guide her through. They made it out the door.

“Where to?” asked Jonah. “Her face is so pale.”

Kaylah realized Amy was already checking her pulse.

“I’m, I’m okay,” she whispered.

“Yes, you are,” said Amy briskly. “Let’s get you to your quarters.”

“Mr. Broussard?” Again, Jonah pushed her father to get him moving. “Your quarters.”

Her father started plodding down the hall, and they followed.

“Why was—” her voice wobbled “—everyone so kind to me?”

“They know you saved us.”

Kaylah stumbled. “What? I don’t understand.” Only Amy’s steady hand kept her from falling. “I’ve been out of it in sick bay for, what, weeks?”

Jonah and Amy exchanged glances. “It was closer to three months,” Amy said gently.

“Three months?”

“Almost.”

“Oh.”

The corridor was blissfully dim. And quiet. Her father was ahead of them, already climbing the ladder to crew quarters with a stolid ponderous cadence.

“Are we at Heinlein station?” she asked softly.

“Getting close.”

She started weeping silently.

“Kaylah, why are you crying?”

“I don’t know!” She hiccuped. “I hate crying!”

“Maybe from your body is purging the meds.” Amy patted her on the shoulder. “And everything else! Well, I guess it’s to be expected. You’ve been through so much.” She paused as their small group climbed up. “I admire you.”

“What? Me?”

Jonah cleared his throat. “So, you know those nightmares you’ve been having?”

Amy shot him a wry look.

“Uh, I mean, you know how you modeled that ship?”

“Which one?” she asked as she climbed the ladder to crew quarters.

“You’ve dreamed of more than one ship?” asked Amy. She and Jonah again exchanged glances.

“Uh, yeah.”

“The ship in the binary star system,” Jonah confirmed.

Kaylah sighed. “Aria told you?”

“Well, Aria told Mr. Emmett, then Mr. Emmett told the captain, who told—”

“It figures. We’re in a can of gossip.”

“Can?” chuckled Amy. “Nice to see your sense of humor is intact.”

*I have a sense of humor?*

The floor gratings rattled under their feet.

“When the stutter happened, we came out in that system.”

Kaylah froze. “Everyone knows?”

He nodded.

Amy’s voice came from behind. “You’re not surprised? That it, the star system, matches? That it’s real?”

Kaylah resumed walking. “Well… sorta. Aria and I found the matching star system a long time ago. I couldn’t… couldn’t quite believe it matched. The ship was there?”

“Yes, just like you described.”

Kaylah shuddered. “That’s awful.”

“Yeah, by all accounts, it was pretty grim,” Jonah said. “But you know what the weird thing was?”

“The blessed thing.” Amy added.

“What?”

“The ship had the parts we needed.”

“Huh?” Kaylah stopped in the corridor with a rattle of floor grating.

“Remember the broken part, the one we couldn’t replace, after the stutter?”

“Um, yeah, I heard about it in medbay.”

“The derelict had replacement parts.”

Stunned, Kaylah could only stare. Finally, she asked, “The parts from the derelict kept us from being stranded, like, forever?”

“Yes.”

They continued on in silence. The corridor here in crew quarters was cramped. Even Kaylah had to duck under conduits in a couple of places.

“What—” Jonah cleared his throat. “What was the second dream?”

## Epilogue

The starlight played on Emmett’s face. The bridge viewscreen stretched out around him. The ship cruised toward the asteroid in the almost empty system for the last water stop before the station.

He leaned back and stretched. The colonists were happy, the crew were happy. Their journey was nearing its end.

His eyes flicked to the display. The drones were prepped and ready to go, the crew would be on stand-by within min—

A warning bell tolled. “Incoming vessel,” Aria sang.

“I see it.”

“This close to the station, not impossible to run into another ship, I suppose,” muttered Emmett to himself.

“A smaller ship.”

“Thanks, Aria. Hmmm…”

Data popped up on displays, one on the ship itself, one for identification.

“Broadcasting a courier ID,” said Aria.

Sensors were refining the ship’s image.

Emmett squinted. The ship’s contours were familiar…

He brought up a stored image to compare with the one being refined.

They matched.

He stared at the two images in horror.

“Bogey! Bogey! Bogey!” he cried out. He braced.

*Brio’s Hope* surged, clawing a path away from the incoming ship — the marauder from Kaylah’s second nightmare.
